Comment:
 APT is an old software with lots of contributors over its lifetime. This
 file is a best effort to document the statements of copyright and licenses
 as stated in the file, but is not a complete representation of all copyright
 holders - those have been lost to times.
 .
 Several bits of apt-pkg/contrib have had public domain dedications but
 contributions from authors in countries not recognizing a public domain
 concept. We believe that these contributions have been done in good faith,
 and we treat them as if they had been made under the GPL-2+ as we believe
 some contributors may have missed these facts and the overall license statement
 for the project has always been GPL-2+, so we cannot be sure that contributors
 meant to grant additional permissions.
 .
 Translation files are considered to generally be GPL-2+,
 but they also include strings used by methods/rsh.cc which appears to be GPL-2.
 As the translations are split into separate domains later on,
 these strings are not loaded by library users outside of apt
 (they are in the 'apt' translation domain).
 .
 The apt-pkg/contrib/fileutl.cc file states "RunScripts()" is "GPLv2".
 We believe that this was not meant to exclude later versions of the GPL,
 as that would have changed the overall project license.

Comment:
 This file stated:
 Licensed under the GNU General Public License v2 [no exception clauses]

 We believe that this was intended to be not a statement against future
 versions of the GPL, but meant to exclude the Qt license exception in
 place in APT until that time.
 .
 We received permission from Ben in 2021 to relicense under GPL-2+,
 contributions from Adam Heath and Daniel Hartwig may still have to
 be considered GPL-2 for the time being.

 Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
 non-exclusive license:
 .
 (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
     Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
     modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its

     Contributions or its Contributor Version.
 .
 2.2. Effective Date
 .
 The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
 become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
 distributes such Contribution.
 .
 2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
 .
 The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
 this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
 distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
 Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
 Contributor:
 .
 (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
     or
 .
 (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
     modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
     Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
     Version); or
 .
 (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
     its Contributions.
 .
 This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
 or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
 the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
 .
 2.4. Subsequent Licenses
 .
 No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
 distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
 License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
 permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
 .
 2.5. Representation
 .
 Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
 Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
 to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
 .
 2.6. Fair Use
 .
 This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
 applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
 equivalents.
 .
 2.7. Conditions
 .
 Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
 in Section 2.1.
 .
 3. Responsibilities
 -------------------
 .
 3.1. Distribution of Source Form
 .
 All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
 Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
 the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
 Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
 License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
 attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
 Form.
 .
 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
 .
 If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
 .
 (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
     Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
     the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
     Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
     than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
 .
 (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
     License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
     license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
     the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
 .
 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
 .
 You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
 provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
 the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
 Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
 Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
 License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
 under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
 the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
 Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
 License(s).
 .
 3.4. Notices
 .
 You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
 (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
 or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
 the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
 the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
 .
 3.5. Application of Additional Terms
 .
 You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
 indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
 Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
 behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
 such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
 You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
 liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
 indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
 disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
 jurisdiction.
 .
 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
 ---------------------------------------------------
 .
 If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
 License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
 statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
 the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
 describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
 be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
 Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
 or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
 recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
 .
 5. Termination
 --------------
 .
 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
 if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
 compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
 Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
 Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
 ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
 non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
 come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
 Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
 notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
 first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
 from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
 Your receipt of the notice.
 .
 5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
 infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
 counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
 directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
 You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
 2.1 of this License shall terminate.
 .
 5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
 end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
 have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
 prior to termination shall survive termination.
 .

 *  Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is"       *
 *  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or  *
 *  statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the       *
 *  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *
 *  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the     *
 *  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        *
 *  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     *
 *  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *
 *  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *
 *  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is   *
 *  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.         *
 *                                                                      *

 *                                                                      *
 *  7. Limitation of Liability                                          *
 *  --------------------------                                          *
 *                                                                      *
 *  Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort      *
 *  (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any           *
 *  Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as          *
 *  permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect,         *
 *  special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character      *
 *  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    *
 *  goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any    *
 *  and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party      *
 *  shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This   *
 *  limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or   *
 *  personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the       *
 *  extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some               *
 *  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *
 *  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and          *
 *  limitation may not apply to You.                                    *
 *                                                                      *
 ************************************************************************
 .
 8. Litigation
 -------------
 .
 Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
 courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
 place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
 jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
 Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
 cross-claims or counter-claims.
 .
 9. Miscellaneous
 ----------------
 .
 This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
 matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
 unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
 necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
 that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
 shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
 .
 10. Versions of the License
 ---------------------------
 .
 10.1. New Versions
 .
 Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
 publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
 distinguishing version number.
 .
 10.2. Effect of New Versions
 .
 You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
 of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
 or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
 steward.
 .
 10.3. Modified Versions
 .
 If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
 create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
 modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
 any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
 such modified license differs from this License).
 .
 10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
 Licenses
 .
 If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
 Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
 notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.
 .
 Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice

   License, v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this

 .
 If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
 file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
 file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look
 for such a notice.
 .
 You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.
 .

cpp-13:
This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the GNU compiler
collection, containing Ada, C, C++, D, Fortran 95, Go, Objective-C,
Objective-C++, and Modula-2 compilers, documentation, and support
libraries.  In addition, Debian provides the gm2 compiler, either in
the same source package, or built from a separate same source package.
Packaging is done by the Debian GCC Maintainers
<debian-gcc@lists.debian.org>, with sources obtained from:

  ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/releases/  (for full releases)
  svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/           (for prereleases)
  ftp://sourceware.org/pub/newlib/     (for newlib)
  git://git.savannah.gnu.org/gm2.git   (for Modula-2)

The current gcc-13 source package is taken from the git gcc-13-branch.

Changes: See changelog.Debian.gz

Debian splits the GNU Compiler Collection into packages for each language,
library, and documentation as follows:

Language       Compiler package  Library package    Documentation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ada            gnat-13          libgnat-13          gnat-13-doc
C              gcc-13                              gcc-13-doc
C++            g++-13           libstdc++6         libstdc++6-13-doc
D              gdc-13
Fortran 95     gfortran-13      libgfortran5       gfortran-13-doc
Go             gccgo-13         libgo0
Objective C    gobjc-13         libobjc4
Objective C++  gobjc++-13
Modula-2       gm2-13           libgm2

For some language run-time libraries, Debian provides source files,
development files, debugging symbols and libraries containing position-
independent code in separate packages:

Language  Sources      Development   Debugging            Position-Independent
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C++                                  libstdc++6-13-dbg  libstdc++6-13-pic
D         libphobos-13-dev

Additional packages include:

All languages:
libgcc1, libgcc2, libgcc4       GCC intrinsics (platform-dependent)
gcc-13-base                    Base files common to all compilers
gcc-13-soft-float              Software floating point (ARM only)
gcc-13-source                  The sources with patches

Ada:
libgnat-util13-dev, libgnat-util13   GNAT version library

C:
cpp-13, cpp-13-doc            GNU C Preprocessor
libssp0-dev, libssp0            GCC stack smashing protection library
libquadmath0                    Math routines for the __float128 type
fixincludes                     Fix non-ANSI header files

C, C++ and Fortran 95:
libgomp1-dev, libgomp1		GCC OpenMP (GOMP) support library
libitm1-dev, libitm1		GNU Transactional Memory Library

Biarch support: On some 64-bit platforms which can also run 32-bit code,
Debian provides additional packages containing 32-bit versions of some
libraries.  These packages have names beginning with 'lib32' instead of
'lib', for example lib32stdc++6.  Similarly, on some 32-bit platforms which
can also run 64-bit code, Debian provides additional packages with names
beginning with 'lib64' instead of 'lib'.  These packages contain 64-bit
versions of the libraries.  (At this time, not all platforms and not all
libraries support biarch.)  The license terms for these lib32 or lib64
packages are identical to the ones for the lib packages.

GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION

Version 3.1, 31 March 2009

Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that
bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that
the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.

When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of
certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled
program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of
non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the
header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.

0. Definitions.

A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime
Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an
interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
on the Runtime Library.

"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
subsequent versions published by the FSF.

"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,
modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with
the license of GCC.

"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for
input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
for producing a compiler intermediate representation.

The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in
non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,
use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
understood as starting with the output of the generators or
preprocessors.

A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or
with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
Eligible Compilation Process.

1. Grant of Additional Permission.

You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You
may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.

2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.

The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
requirements of the license of GCC.

The newlib subdirectory is a collection of software from several sources.
Each file may have its own copyright/license that is embedded in the source
file.

This list documents those licenses which are more restrictive than
a BSD-like license or require the copyright notice
to be duplicated in documentation and/or other materials associated with
the distribution.  Certain licenses documented here only apply to
specific targets.  Certain clauses only apply if you are building the
code as part of your binary.

Note that this list may omit certain licenses that
only pertain to the copying/modifying of the individual source code.
If you are distributing the source code, then you do not need to
worry about these omitted licenses, so long as you do not modify the
copyright information already in place.

************************************

cpp-13-x86-64-linux-gnu:
This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the GNU compiler
collection, containing Ada, C, C++, D, Fortran 95, Go, Objective-C,
Objective-C++, and Modula-2 compilers, documentation, and support
libraries.  In addition, Debian provides the gm2 compiler, either in
the same source package, or built from a separate same source package.
Packaging is done by the Debian GCC Maintainers
<debian-gcc@lists.debian.org>, with sources obtained from:

  ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/releases/  (for full releases)
  svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/           (for prereleases)
  ftp://sourceware.org/pub/newlib/     (for newlib)
  git://git.savannah.gnu.org/gm2.git   (for Modula-2)

The current gcc-13 source package is taken from the git gcc-13-branch.

Changes: See changelog.Debian.gz

Debian splits the GNU Compiler Collection into packages for each language,
library, and documentation as follows:

Language       Compiler package  Library package    Documentation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ada            gnat-13          libgnat-13          gnat-13-doc
C              gcc-13                              gcc-13-doc
C++            g++-13           libstdc++6         libstdc++6-13-doc
D              gdc-13
Fortran 95     gfortran-13      libgfortran5       gfortran-13-doc
Go             gccgo-13         libgo0
Objective C    gobjc-13         libobjc4
Objective C++  gobjc++-13
Modula-2       gm2-13           libgm2

For some language run-time libraries, Debian provides source files,
development files, debugging symbols and libraries containing position-
independent code in separate packages:

Language  Sources      Development   Debugging            Position-Independent
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C++                                  libstdc++6-13-dbg  libstdc++6-13-pic
D         libphobos-13-dev

Additional packages include:

All languages:
libgcc1, libgcc2, libgcc4       GCC intrinsics (platform-dependent)
gcc-13-base                    Base files common to all compilers
gcc-13-soft-float              Software floating point (ARM only)
gcc-13-source                  The sources with patches

Ada:
libgnat-util13-dev, libgnat-util13   GNAT version library

C:
cpp-13, cpp-13-doc            GNU C Preprocessor
libssp0-dev, libssp0            GCC stack smashing protection library
libquadmath0                    Math routines for the __float128 type
fixincludes                     Fix non-ANSI header files

C, C++ and Fortran 95:
libgomp1-dev, libgomp1		GCC OpenMP (GOMP) support library
libitm1-dev, libitm1		GNU Transactional Memory Library

Biarch support: On some 64-bit platforms which can also run 32-bit code,
Debian provides additional packages containing 32-bit versions of some
libraries.  These packages have names beginning with 'lib32' instead of
'lib', for example lib32stdc++6.  Similarly, on some 32-bit platforms which
can also run 64-bit code, Debian provides additional packages with names
beginning with 'lib64' instead of 'lib'.  These packages contain 64-bit
versions of the libraries.  (At this time, not all platforms and not all
libraries support biarch.)  The license terms for these lib32 or lib64
packages are identical to the ones for the lib packages.

GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION

Version 3.1, 31 March 2009

Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that
bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that
the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.

When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of
certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled
program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of
non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the
header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.

0. Definitions.

A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime
Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an
interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
on the Runtime Library.

"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
subsequent versions published by the FSF.

"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,
modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with
the license of GCC.

"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for
input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
for producing a compiler intermediate representation.

The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in
non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,
use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
understood as starting with the output of the generators or
preprocessors.

A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or
with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
Eligible Compilation Process.

1. Grant of Additional Permission.

You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You
may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.

2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.

The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
requirements of the license of GCC.

1. License Agreement for NVIDIA Software Development Kits
---------------------------------------------------------


Important Notice—Read before downloading, installing,
copying or using the licensed software:
-------------------------------------------------------

This license agreement, including exhibits attached
("Agreement”) is a legal agreement between you and NVIDIA
Corporation ("NVIDIA") and governs your use of a NVIDIA
software development kit (“SDK”).

Each SDK has its own set of software and materials, but here
is a description of the types of items that may be included in
a SDK: source code, header files, APIs, data sets and assets
(examples include images, textures, models, scenes, videos,
native API input/output files), binary software, sample code,
libraries, utility programs, programming code and
documentation.

This Agreement can be accepted only by an adult of legal age
of majority in the country in which the SDK is used.

If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company
or other legal entity, you represent that you have the legal
authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, in which case
“you” will mean the entity you represent.

If you don’t have the required age or authority to accept
this Agreement, or if you don’t accept all the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, do not download, install or use
the SDK.

You agree to use the SDK only for purposes that are permitted
by (a) this Agreement, and (b) any applicable law, regulation
or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant
jurisdictions.


1.1. License


1.1.1. License Grant

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, NVIDIA hereby grants
you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license, without the
right to sublicense (except as expressly provided in this
Agreement) to:

  1. Install and use the SDK,

  2. Modify and create derivative works of sample source code
    delivered in the SDK, and

  3. Distribute those portions of the SDK that are identified
    in this Agreement as distributable, as incorporated in
    object code format into a software application that meets
    the distribution requirements indicated in this Agreement.


1.1.2. Distribution Requirements

These are the distribution requirements for you to exercise
the distribution grant:

  1. Your application must have material additional
    functionality, beyond the included portions of the SDK.

  2. The distributable portions of the SDK shall only be
    accessed by your application.

  3. The following notice shall be included in modifications
    and derivative works of sample source code distributed:
    “This software contains source code provided by NVIDIA
    Corporation.”

  4. Unless a developer tool is identified in this Agreement
    as distributable, it is delivered for your internal use
    only.

  5. The terms under which you distribute your application
    must be consistent with the terms of this Agreement,
    including (without limitation) terms relating to the
    license grant and license restrictions and protection of
    NVIDIA’s intellectual property rights. Additionally, you
    agree that you will protect the privacy, security and
    legal rights of your application users.

  6. You agree to notify NVIDIA in writing of any known or
    suspected distribution or use of the SDK not in compliance
    with the requirements of this Agreement, and to enforce
    the terms of your agreements with respect to distributed
    SDK.


1.1.3. Authorized Users

You may allow employees and contractors of your entity or of
your subsidiary(ies) to access and use the SDK from your
secure network to perform work on your behalf.

If you are an academic institution you may allow users
enrolled or employed by the academic institution to access and
use the SDK from your secure network.

You are responsible for the compliance with the terms of this
Agreement by your authorized users. If you become aware that
your authorized users didn’t follow the terms of this
Agreement, you agree to take reasonable steps to resolve the
non-compliance and prevent new occurrences.


1.1.4. Pre-Release SDK

The SDK versions identified as alpha, beta, preview or
otherwise as pre-release, may not be fully functional, may
contain errors or design flaws, and may have reduced or
different security, privacy, accessibility, availability, and
reliability standards relative to commercial versions of
NVIDIA software and materials. Use of a pre-release SDK may
result in unexpected results, loss of data, project delays or
other unpredictable damage or loss.

You may use a pre-release SDK at your own risk, understanding
that pre-release SDKs are not intended for use in production
or business-critical systems.

NVIDIA may choose not to make available a commercial version
of any pre-release SDK. NVIDIA may also choose to abandon
development and terminate the availability of a pre-release
SDK at any time without liability.


1.1.5. Updates

NVIDIA may, at its option, make available patches, workarounds
or other updates to this SDK. Unless the updates are provided
with their separate governing terms, they are deemed part of
the SDK licensed to you as provided in this Agreement. You
agree that the form and content of the SDK that NVIDIA
provides may change without prior notice to you. While NVIDIA
generally maintains compatibility between versions, NVIDIA may
in some cases make changes that introduce incompatibilities in
future versions of the SDK.


1.1.6. Components Under Other Licenses

The SDK may come bundled with, or otherwise include or be
distributed with, NVIDIA or third-party components with
separate legal notices or terms as may be described in
proprietary notices accompanying the SDK. If and to the extent
there is a conflict between the terms in this Agreement and
the license terms associated with the component, the license
terms associated with the components control only to the
extent necessary to resolve the conflict.

Subject to the other terms of this Agreement, you may use the
SDK to develop and test applications released under Open
Source Initiative (OSI) approved open source software
licenses.


1.1.7. Reservation of Rights

NVIDIA reserves all rights, title, and interest in and to the
SDK, not expressly granted to you under this Agreement.


1.2. Limitations

SDK:

  1. You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble,
    or remove copyright or other proprietary notices from any
    portion of the SDK or copies of the SDK.

  2. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, you may
    not copy, sell, rent, sublicense, transfer, distribute,
    modify, or create derivative works of any portion of the
    SDK. For clarity, you may not distribute or sublicense the
    SDK as a stand-alone product.

  3. Unless you have an agreement with NVIDIA for this
    purpose, you may not indicate that an application created
    with the SDK is sponsored or endorsed by NVIDIA.

  4. You may not bypass, disable, or circumvent any
    encryption, security, digital rights management or
    authentication mechanism in the SDK.

  5. You may not use the SDK in any manner that would cause it
    to become subject to an open source software license. As
    examples, licenses that require as a condition of use,
    modification, and/or distribution that the SDK be:

      a. Disclosed or distributed in source code form;

      b. Licensed for the purpose of making derivative works;
        or

      c. Redistributable at no charge.

  6.  You acknowledge that the SDK as delivered is not tested
    or certified by NVIDIA for use in connection with the
    design, construction, maintenance, and/or operation of any
    system where the use or failure of such system could
    result in a situation that threatens the safety of human
    life or results in catastrophic damages (each, a "Critical
    Application"). Examples of Critical Applications include
    use in avionics, navigation, autonomous vehicle
    applications, ai solutions for automotive products,
    military, medical, life support or other life critical
    applications. NVIDIA shall not be liable to you or any
    third party, in whole or in part, for any claims or
    damages arising from such uses. You are solely responsible
    for ensuring that any product or service developed with
    the SDK as a whole includes sufficient features to comply
    with all applicable legal and regulatory standards and
    requirements.

  7.  You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless NVIDIA
    and its affiliates, and their respective employees,
    contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and
    against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses,
    liabilities, costs or debt, fines, restitutions and
    expenses (including but not limited to attorney’s fees
    and costs incident to establishing the right of
    indemnification) arising out of or related to products or
    services that use the SDK in or for Critical Applications,
    and for use of the SDK outside of the scope of this
    Agreement or not in compliance with its terms.

  8. You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble
    any portion of the output generated using SDK elements for
    the purpose of translating such output artifacts to target
    a non-NVIDIA platform.


1.3. Ownership

  1.  NVIDIA or its licensors hold all rights, title and
    interest in and to the SDK and its modifications and
    derivative works, including their respective intellectual
    property rights, subject to your rights under Section
    1.3.2. This SDK may include software and materials from
    NVIDIA’s licensors, and these licensors are intended
    third party beneficiaries that may enforce this Agreement
    with respect to their intellectual property rights.

  2.  You hold all rights, title and interest in and to your
    applications and your derivative works of the sample
    source code delivered in the SDK, including their
    respective intellectual property rights, subject to
    NVIDIA’s rights under Section 1.3.1.

  3. You may, but don’t have to, provide to NVIDIA
    suggestions, feature requests or other feedback regarding
    the SDK, including possible enhancements or modifications
    to the SDK. For any feedback that you voluntarily provide,
    you hereby grant NVIDIA and its affiliates a perpetual,
    non-exclusive, worldwide, irrevocable license to use,
    reproduce, modify, license, sublicense (through multiple
    tiers of sublicensees), and distribute (through multiple
    tiers of distributors) it without the payment of any
    royalties or fees to you. NVIDIA will use feedback at its

1.4. No Warranties

THE SDK IS PROVIDED BY NVIDIA “AS IS” AND “WITH ALL
FAULTS.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NVIDIA AND
ITS AFFILIATES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
OR NATURE, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING,
BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THE
ABSENCE OF ANY DEFECTS THEREIN, WHETHER LATENT OR PATENT. NO
WARRANTY IS MADE ON THE BASIS OF TRADE USAGE, COURSE OF
DEALING OR COURSE OF TRADE.


1.5. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NVIDIA AND ITS
AFFILIATES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY (I) SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR (II) DAMAGES FOR (A) ANY
LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF DATA OR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
OR THE COSTS OF PROCURING SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS, ARISING OUT OF
OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OR PERFORMANCE
OF THE SDK, WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY ARISES FROM ANY CLAIM BASED
UPON BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER CAUSE OF ACTION OR
THEORY OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT WILL NVIDIA’S AND ITS AFFILIATES
TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY UNDER OR ARISING OUT OF THIS
AGREEMENT EXCEED US$10.00. THE NATURE OF THE LIABILITY OR THE
NUMBER OF CLAIMS OR SUITS SHALL NOT ENLARGE OR EXTEND THIS
LIMIT.

These exclusions and limitations of liability shall apply
regardless if NVIDIA or its affiliates have been advised of
the possibility of such damages, and regardless of whether a
remedy fails its essential purpose. These exclusions and
limitations of liability form an essential basis of the
bargain between the parties, and, absent any of these
exclusions or limitations of liability, the provisions of this
Agreement, including, without limitation, the economic terms,
would be substantially different.


1.6. Termination

  1. This Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by
    either you or NVIDIA as described below.

  2. If you want to terminate this Agreement, you may do so by
    stopping to use the SDK.

    ------------
    PCRE LICENCE
    ------------
    PCRE is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
    and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.
    Release 8 of PCRE is distributed under the terms of the "BSD" licence, as
    specified below. The documentation for PCRE, supplied in the "doc"
    directory, is distributed under the same terms as the software itself. The
    basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also
    included in the distribution is a set of C++ wrapper functions, and a just-
    in-time compiler that can be used to optimize pattern matching. These are
    both optional features that can be omitted when the library is built.

copying or using the licensed software:
-------------------------------------------------------

This license agreement, including exhibits attached
("Agreement”) is a legal agreement between you and NVIDIA
Corporation ("NVIDIA") and governs your use of a NVIDIA
software development kit (“SDK”).

Each SDK has its own set of software and materials, but here
is a description of the types of items that may be included in
a SDK: source code, header files, APIs, data sets and assets
(examples include images, textures, models, scenes, videos,
native API input/output files), binary software, sample code,
libraries, utility programs, programming code and
documentation.

This Agreement can be accepted only by an adult of legal age
of majority in the country in which the SDK is used.

If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company
or other legal entity, you represent that you have the legal
authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, in which case
“you” will mean the entity you represent.

If you don’t have the required age or authority to accept
this Agreement, or if you don’t accept all the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, do not download, install or use
the SDK.

You agree to use the SDK only for purposes that are permitted
by (a) this Agreement, and (b) any applicable law, regulation
or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant
jurisdictions.


1.1. License


1.1.1. License Grant

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, NVIDIA hereby grants
you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license, without the
right to sublicense (except as expressly provided in this
Agreement) to:

  1. Install and use the SDK,

  2. Modify and create derivative works of sample source code
    delivered in the SDK, and

  3. Distribute those portions of the SDK that are identified
    in this Agreement as distributable, as incorporated in
    object code format into a software application that meets
    the distribution requirements indicated in this Agreement.


1.1.2. Distribution Requirements

These are the distribution requirements for you to exercise
the distribution grant:

  1. Your application must have material additional
    functionality, beyond the included portions of the SDK.

  2. The distributable portions of the SDK shall only be
    accessed by your application.

  3. The following notice shall be included in modifications
    and derivative works of sample source code distributed:
    “This software contains source code provided by NVIDIA
    Corporation.”

  4. Unless a developer tool is identified in this Agreement
    as distributable, it is delivered for your internal use
    only.

  5. The terms under which you distribute your application
    must be consistent with the terms of this Agreement,
    including (without limitation) terms relating to the
    license grant and license restrictions and protection of
    NVIDIA’s intellectual property rights. Additionally, you
    agree that you will protect the privacy, security and
    legal rights of your application users.

  6. You agree to notify NVIDIA in writing of any known or
    suspected distribution or use of the SDK not in compliance
    with the requirements of this Agreement, and to enforce
    the terms of your agreements with respect to distributed
    SDK.


1.1.3. Authorized Users

You may allow employees and contractors of your entity or of
your subsidiary(ies) to access and use the SDK from your
secure network to perform work on your behalf.

If you are an academic institution you may allow users
enrolled or employed by the academic institution to access and
use the SDK from your secure network.

You are responsible for the compliance with the terms of this
Agreement by your authorized users. If you become aware that
your authorized users didn’t follow the terms of this
Agreement, you agree to take reasonable steps to resolve the
non-compliance and prevent new occurrences.


1.1.4. Pre-Release SDK

The SDK versions identified as alpha, beta, preview or
otherwise as pre-release, may not be fully functional, may
contain errors or design flaws, and may have reduced or
different security, privacy, accessibility, availability, and
reliability standards relative to commercial versions of
NVIDIA software and materials. Use of a pre-release SDK may
result in unexpected results, loss of data, project delays or
other unpredictable damage or loss.

You may use a pre-release SDK at your own risk, understanding
that pre-release SDKs are not intended for use in production
or business-critical systems.

NVIDIA may choose not to make available a commercial version
of any pre-release SDK. NVIDIA may also choose to abandon
development and terminate the availability of a pre-release
SDK at any time without liability.


1.1.5. Updates

NVIDIA may, at its option, make available patches, workarounds
or other updates to this SDK. Unless the updates are provided
with their separate governing terms, they are deemed part of
the SDK licensed to you as provided in this Agreement. You
agree that the form and content of the SDK that NVIDIA
provides may change without prior notice to you. While NVIDIA
generally maintains compatibility between versions, NVIDIA may
in some cases make changes that introduce incompatibilities in
future versions of the SDK.


1.1.6. Components Under Other Licenses

The SDK may come bundled with, or otherwise include or be
distributed with, NVIDIA or third-party components with
separate legal notices or terms as may be described in
proprietary notices accompanying the SDK. If and to the extent
there is a conflict between the terms in this Agreement and
the license terms associated with the component, the license
terms associated with the components control only to the
extent necessary to resolve the conflict.

Subject to the other terms of this Agreement, you may use the
SDK to develop and test applications released under Open
Source Initiative (OSI) approved open source software
licenses.


1.1.7. Reservation of Rights

NVIDIA reserves all rights, title, and interest in and to the
SDK, not expressly granted to you under this Agreement.

SDK:

  1. You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble,
    or remove copyright or other proprietary notices from any
    portion of the SDK or copies of the SDK.

  2. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, you may
    not copy, sell, rent, sublicense, transfer, distribute,
    modify, or create derivative works of any portion of the
    SDK. For clarity, you may not distribute or sublicense the
    SDK as a stand-alone product.

  3. Unless you have an agreement with NVIDIA for this
    purpose, you may not indicate that an application created
    with the SDK is sponsored or endorsed by NVIDIA.

  4. You may not bypass, disable, or circumvent any
    encryption, security, digital rights management or
    authentication mechanism in the SDK.

  5. You may not use the SDK in any manner that would cause it

OR NATURE, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING,
BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THE
ABSENCE OF ANY DEFECTS THEREIN, WHETHER LATENT OR PATENT. NO
WARRANTY IS MADE ON THE BASIS OF TRADE USAGE, COURSE OF
DEALING OR COURSE OF TRADE.


1.5. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NVIDIA AND ITS
AFFILIATES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY (I) SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR (II) DAMAGES FOR (A) ANY

regardless if NVIDIA or its affiliates have been advised of
the possibility of such damages, and regardless of whether a
remedy fails its essential purpose. These exclusions and
limitations of liability form an essential basis of the
bargain between the parties, and, absent any of these
exclusions or limitations of liability, the provisions of this
Agreement, including, without limitation, the economic terms,
would be substantially different.


1.6. Termination

    ------------
    PCRE LICENCE
    ------------
    PCRE is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
    and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.
    Release 8 of PCRE is distributed under the terms of the "BSD" licence, as
    specified below. The documentation for PCRE, supplied in the "doc"
    directory, is distributed under the same terms as the software itself. The
    basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also
    included in the distribution is a set of C++ wrapper functions, and a just-
    in-time compiler that can be used to optimize pattern matching. These are
    both optional features that can be omitted when the library is built.

Important Notice—Read before downloading, installing,
copying or using the licensed software:
-------------------------------------------------------

This license agreement, including exhibits attached
("Agreement”) is a legal agreement between you and NVIDIA
Corporation ("NVIDIA") and governs your use of a NVIDIA
software development kit (“SDK”).

Each SDK has its own set of software and materials, but here
is a description of the types of items that may be included in
a SDK: source code, header files, APIs, data sets and assets
(examples include images, textures, models, scenes, videos,
native API input/output files), binary software, sample code,
libraries, utility programs, programming code and
documentation.

This Agreement can be accepted only by an adult of legal age
of majority in the country in which the SDK is used.

If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company
or other legal entity, you represent that you have the legal
authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, in which case
“you” will mean the entity you represent.

If you don’t have the required age or authority to accept
this Agreement, or if you don’t accept all the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, do not download, install or use
the SDK.

You agree to use the SDK only for purposes that are permitted
by (a) this Agreement, and (b) any applicable law, regulation
or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant
jurisdictions.


1.1. License


1.1.1. License Grant

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, NVIDIA hereby grants
you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license, without the
right to sublicense (except as expressly provided in this
Agreement) to:

  1. Install and use the SDK,

  2. Modify and create derivative works of sample source code
    delivered in the SDK, and

  3. Distribute those portions of the SDK that are identified
    in this Agreement as distributable, as incorporated in
    object code format into a software application that meets
    the distribution requirements indicated in this Agreement.


1.1.2. Distribution Requirements

These are the distribution requirements for you to exercise
the distribution grant:

  1. Your application must have material additional
    functionality, beyond the included portions of the SDK.

  2. The distributable portions of the SDK shall only be
    accessed by your application.

  3. The following notice shall be included in modifications
    and derivative works of sample source code distributed:
    “This software contains source code provided by NVIDIA
    Corporation.”

  4. Unless a developer tool is identified in this Agreement
    as distributable, it is delivered for your internal use
    only.

  5. The terms under which you distribute your application
    must be consistent with the terms of this Agreement,
    including (without limitation) terms relating to the
    license grant and license restrictions and protection of
    NVIDIA’s intellectual property rights. Additionally, you
    agree that you will protect the privacy, security and
    legal rights of your application users.

  6. You agree to notify NVIDIA in writing of any known or
    suspected distribution or use of the SDK not in compliance
    with the requirements of this Agreement, and to enforce
    the terms of your agreements with respect to distributed
    SDK.


1.1.3. Authorized Users

You may allow employees and contractors of your entity or of
your subsidiary(ies) to access and use the SDK from your
secure network to perform work on your behalf.

If you are an academic institution you may allow users
enrolled or employed by the academic institution to access and
use the SDK from your secure network.

You are responsible for the compliance with the terms of this
Agreement by your authorized users. If you become aware that
your authorized users didn’t follow the terms of this
Agreement, you agree to take reasonable steps to resolve the
non-compliance and prevent new occurrences.


1.1.4. Pre-Release SDK

The SDK versions identified as alpha, beta, preview or
otherwise as pre-release, may not be fully functional, may
contain errors or design flaws, and may have reduced or
different security, privacy, accessibility, availability, and
reliability standards relative to commercial versions of
NVIDIA software and materials. Use of a pre-release SDK may
result in unexpected results, loss of data, project delays or
other unpredictable damage or loss.

You may use a pre-release SDK at your own risk, understanding
that pre-release SDKs are not intended for use in production
or business-critical systems.

NVIDIA may choose not to make available a commercial version
of any pre-release SDK. NVIDIA may also choose to abandon
development and terminate the availability of a pre-release
SDK at any time without liability.


1.1.5. Updates

NVIDIA may, at its option, make available patches, workarounds
or other updates to this SDK. Unless the updates are provided
with their separate governing terms, they are deemed part of
the SDK licensed to you as provided in this Agreement. You
agree that the form and content of the SDK that NVIDIA
provides may change without prior notice to you. While NVIDIA
generally maintains compatibility between versions, NVIDIA may
in some cases make changes that introduce incompatibilities in
future versions of the SDK.


1.1.6. Components Under Other Licenses

The SDK may come bundled with, or otherwise include or be
distributed with, NVIDIA or third-party components with
separate legal notices or terms as may be described in
proprietary notices accompanying the SDK. If and to the extent
there is a conflict between the terms in this Agreement and
the license terms associated with the component, the license
terms associated with the components control only to the
extent necessary to resolve the conflict.

Subject to the other terms of this Agreement, you may use the
SDK to develop and test applications released under Open
Source Initiative (OSI) approved open source software
licenses.


1.1.7. Reservation of Rights

NVIDIA reserves all rights, title, and interest in and to the
SDK, not expressly granted to you under this Agreement.


1.2. Limitations

SDK:

  1. You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble,
    or remove copyright or other proprietary notices from any
    portion of the SDK or copies of the SDK.

  2. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, you may
    not copy, sell, rent, sublicense, transfer, distribute,
    modify, or create derivative works of any portion of the
    SDK. For clarity, you may not distribute or sublicense the
    SDK as a stand-alone product.

  3. Unless you have an agreement with NVIDIA for this
    purpose, you may not indicate that an application created
    with the SDK is sponsored or endorsed by NVIDIA.

  4. You may not bypass, disable, or circumvent any
    encryption, security, digital rights management or
    authentication mechanism in the SDK.

  5. You may not use the SDK in any manner that would cause it
    to become subject to an open source software license. As

    with respect to their intellectual property rights.

  2.  You hold all rights, title and interest in and to your
    applications and your derivative works of the sample
    source code delivered in the SDK, including their
    respective intellectual property rights, subject to
    NVIDIA’s rights under Section 1.3.1.

  3. You may, but don’t have to, provide to NVIDIA
    suggestions, feature requests or other feedback regarding
    the SDK, including possible enhancements or modifications
    to the SDK. For any feedback that you voluntarily provide,
    you hereby grant NVIDIA and its affiliates a perpetual,
    non-exclusive, worldwide, irrevocable license to use,
    reproduce, modify, license, sublicense (through multiple
    tiers of sublicensees), and distribute (through multiple
    tiers of distributors) it without the payment of any
    royalties or fees to you. NVIDIA will use feedback at its
    choice. NVIDIA is constantly looking for ways to improve
    its products, so you may send feedback to NVIDIA through
    the developer portal at https://developer.nvidia.com.


1.4. No Warranties

THE SDK IS PROVIDED BY NVIDIA “AS IS” AND “WITH ALL
FAULTS.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NVIDIA AND
ITS AFFILIATES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
OR NATURE, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING,
BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THE
ABSENCE OF ANY DEFECTS THEREIN, WHETHER LATENT OR PATENT. NO
WARRANTY IS MADE ON THE BASIS OF TRADE USAGE, COURSE OF
DEALING OR COURSE OF TRADE.


1.5. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NVIDIA AND ITS
AFFILIATES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY (I) SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR (II) DAMAGES FOR (A) ANY
LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF DATA OR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
OR THE COSTS OF PROCURING SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS, ARISING OUT OF
OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OR PERFORMANCE
OF THE SDK, WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY ARISES FROM ANY CLAIM BASED
UPON BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER CAUSE OF ACTION OR
THEORY OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT WILL NVIDIA’S AND ITS AFFILIATES
TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY UNDER OR ARISING OUT OF THIS
AGREEMENT EXCEED US$10.00. THE NATURE OF THE LIABILITY OR THE
NUMBER OF CLAIMS OR SUITS SHALL NOT ENLARGE OR EXTEND THIS
LIMIT.

These exclusions and limitations of liability shall apply
regardless if NVIDIA or its affiliates have been advised of
the possibility of such damages, and regardless of whether a
remedy fails its essential purpose. These exclusions and
limitations of liability form an essential basis of the
bargain between the parties, and, absent any of these
exclusions or limitations of liability, the provisions of this
Agreement, including, without limitation, the economic terms,
would be substantially different.


1.6. Termination

  1. This Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by
    either you or NVIDIA as described below.

  2. If you want to terminate this Agreement, you may do so by
    stopping to use the SDK.

        continued use of it is no longer commercially viable.

  4. Upon any termination of this Agreement, you agree to
    promptly discontinue use of the SDK and destroy all copies
    in your possession or control. Your prior distributions in
    accordance with this Agreement are not affected by the
    termination of this Agreement. Upon written request, you
    will certify in writing that you have complied with your
    commitments under this section. Upon any termination of
    this Agreement all provisions survive except for the
    license grant provisions.

    ------------
    PCRE LICENCE
    ------------
    PCRE is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
    and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.
    Release 8 of PCRE is distributed under the terms of the "BSD" licence, as
    specified below. The documentation for PCRE, supplied in the "doc"
    directory, is distributed under the same terms as the software itself. The
    basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also
    included in the distribution is a set of C++ wrapper functions, and a just-
    in-time compiler that can be used to optimize pattern matching. These are
    both optional features that can be omitted when the library is built.

1. License Agreement for NVIDIA Software Development Kits
---------------------------------------------------------


Important Notice—Read before downloading, installing,
copying or using the licensed software:
-------------------------------------------------------

This license agreement, including exhibits attached
("Agreement”) is a legal agreement between you and NVIDIA
Corporation ("NVIDIA") and governs your use of a NVIDIA
software development kit (“SDK”).

Each SDK has its own set of software and materials, but here
is a description of the types of items that may be included in
a SDK: source code, header files, APIs, data sets and assets
(examples include images, textures, models, scenes, videos,
native API input/output files), binary software, sample code,
libraries, utility programs, programming code and
documentation.

This Agreement can be accepted only by an adult of legal age
of majority in the country in which the SDK is used.

If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company
or other legal entity, you represent that you have the legal
authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, in which case
“you” will mean the entity you represent.

If you don’t have the required age or authority to accept
this Agreement, or if you don’t accept all the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, do not download, install or use
the SDK.

You agree to use the SDK only for purposes that are permitted
by (a) this Agreement, and (b) any applicable law, regulation
or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant
jurisdictions.


1.1. License


1.1.1. License Grant

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, NVIDIA hereby grants
you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license, without the
right to sublicense (except as expressly provided in this
Agreement) to:

  1. Install and use the SDK,

  2. Modify and create derivative works of sample source code
    delivered in the SDK, and

  3. Distribute those portions of the SDK that are identified
    in this Agreement as distributable, as incorporated in
    object code format into a software application that meets
    the distribution requirements indicated in this Agreement.


1.1.2. Distribution Requirements

These are the distribution requirements for you to exercise
the distribution grant:

  1. Your application must have material additional
    functionality, beyond the included portions of the SDK.

  2. The distributable portions of the SDK shall only be
    accessed by your application.

  3. The following notice shall be included in modifications
    and derivative works of sample source code distributed:
    “This software contains source code provided by NVIDIA
    Corporation.”

  4. Unless a developer tool is identified in this Agreement
    as distributable, it is delivered for your internal use
    only.

  5. The terms under which you distribute your application
    must be consistent with the terms of this Agreement,
    including (without limitation) terms relating to the
    license grant and license restrictions and protection of
    NVIDIA’s intellectual property rights. Additionally, you
    agree that you will protect the privacy, security and
    legal rights of your application users.

  6. You agree to notify NVIDIA in writing of any known or
    suspected distribution or use of the SDK not in compliance
    with the requirements of this Agreement, and to enforce
    the terms of your agreements with respect to distributed
    SDK.


1.1.3. Authorized Users

You may allow employees and contractors of your entity or of
your subsidiary(ies) to access and use the SDK from your
secure network to perform work on your behalf.

If you are an academic institution you may allow users
enrolled or employed by the academic institution to access and
use the SDK from your secure network.

You are responsible for the compliance with the terms of this
Agreement by your authorized users. If you become aware that
your authorized users didn’t follow the terms of this
Agreement, you agree to take reasonable steps to resolve the
non-compliance and prevent new occurrences.


1.1.4. Pre-Release SDK

The SDK versions identified as alpha, beta, preview or
otherwise as pre-release, may not be fully functional, may
contain errors or design flaws, and may have reduced or
different security, privacy, accessibility, availability, and
reliability standards relative to commercial versions of
NVIDIA software and materials. Use of a pre-release SDK may
result in unexpected results, loss of data, project delays or
other unpredictable damage or loss.

You may use a pre-release SDK at your own risk, understanding
that pre-release SDKs are not intended for use in production
or business-critical systems.

NVIDIA may choose not to make available a commercial version
of any pre-release SDK. NVIDIA may also choose to abandon
development and terminate the availability of a pre-release
SDK at any time without liability.


1.1.5. Updates

NVIDIA may, at its option, make available patches, workarounds
or other updates to this SDK. Unless the updates are provided
with their separate governing terms, they are deemed part of
the SDK licensed to you as provided in this Agreement. You
agree that the form and content of the SDK that NVIDIA
provides may change without prior notice to you. While NVIDIA
generally maintains compatibility between versions, NVIDIA may
in some cases make changes that introduce incompatibilities in
future versions of the SDK.


1.1.6. Components Under Other Licenses

The SDK may come bundled with, or otherwise include or be
distributed with, NVIDIA or third-party components with
separate legal notices or terms as may be described in
proprietary notices accompanying the SDK. If and to the extent
there is a conflict between the terms in this Agreement and
the license terms associated with the component, the license
terms associated with the components control only to the
extent necessary to resolve the conflict.

Subject to the other terms of this Agreement, you may use the
SDK to develop and test applications released under Open
Source Initiative (OSI) approved open source software
licenses.


1.1.7. Reservation of Rights

NVIDIA reserves all rights, title, and interest in and to the
SDK, not expressly granted to you under this Agreement.


1.2. Limitations

The following license limitations apply to your use of the
SDK:

  1. You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble,
    or remove copyright or other proprietary notices from any
    portion of the SDK or copies of the SDK.

  2. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, you may
    not copy, sell, rent, sublicense, transfer, distribute,
    modify, or create derivative works of any portion of the
    SDK. For clarity, you may not distribute or sublicense the
    SDK as a stand-alone product.

  3. Unless you have an agreement with NVIDIA for this
    purpose, you may not indicate that an application created
    with the SDK is sponsored or endorsed by NVIDIA.

  4. You may not bypass, disable, or circumvent any
    encryption, security, digital rights management or
    authentication mechanism in the SDK.

  5. You may not use the SDK in any manner that would cause it
    to become subject to an open source software license. As
    examples, licenses that require as a condition of use,
    modification, and/or distribution that the SDK be:

      a. Disclosed or distributed in source code form;

      b. Licensed for the purpose of making derivative works;
        or

      c. Redistributable at no charge.

  6.  You acknowledge that the SDK as delivered is not tested
    or certified by NVIDIA for use in connection with the
    design, construction, maintenance, and/or operation of any
    system where the use or failure of such system could
    result in a situation that threatens the safety of human
    life or results in catastrophic damages (each, a "Critical
    Application"). Examples of Critical Applications include
    use in avionics, navigation, autonomous vehicle
    applications, ai solutions for automotive products,
    military, medical, life support or other life critical
    applications. NVIDIA shall not be liable to you or any
    third party, in whole or in part, for any claims or
    damages arising from such uses. You are solely responsible
    for ensuring that any product or service developed with
    the SDK as a whole includes sufficient features to comply
    with all applicable legal and regulatory standards and
    requirements.

  7.  You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless NVIDIA
    and its affiliates, and their respective employees,
    contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and
    against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses,
    liabilities, costs or debt, fines, restitutions and
    expenses (including but not limited to attorney’s fees
    and costs incident to establishing the right of
    indemnification) arising out of or related to products or
    services that use the SDK in or for Critical Applications,
    and for use of the SDK outside of the scope of this
    Agreement or not in compliance with its terms.

  8. You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble
    any portion of the output generated using SDK elements for
    the purpose of translating such output artifacts to target
    a non-NVIDIA platform.


1.3. Ownership

  1.  NVIDIA or its licensors hold all rights, title and
    interest in and to the SDK and its modifications and
    derivative works, including their respective intellectual
    property rights, subject to your rights under Section
    1.3.2. This SDK may include software and materials from
    NVIDIA’s licensors, and these licensors are intended
    third party beneficiaries that may enforce this Agreement
    with respect to their intellectual property rights.

  2.  You hold all rights, title and interest in and to your
    applications and your derivative works of the sample
    source code delivered in the SDK, including their
    respective intellectual property rights, subject to
    NVIDIA’s rights under Section 1.3.1.

  3. You may, but don’t have to, provide to NVIDIA
    suggestions, feature requests or other feedback regarding
    the SDK, including possible enhancements or modifications
    to the SDK. For any feedback that you voluntarily provide,
    you hereby grant NVIDIA and its affiliates a perpetual,
    non-exclusive, worldwide, irrevocable license to use,
    reproduce, modify, license, sublicense (through multiple
    tiers of sublicensees), and distribute (through multiple
    tiers of distributors) it without the payment of any
    royalties or fees to you. NVIDIA will use feedback at its
    choice. NVIDIA is constantly looking for ways to improve
    its products, so you may send feedback to NVIDIA through
    the developer portal at https://developer.nvidia.com.


1.4. No Warranties

THE SDK IS PROVIDED BY NVIDIA “AS IS” AND “WITH ALL
FAULTS.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NVIDIA AND
ITS AFFILIATES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
OR NATURE, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING,
BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THE
ABSENCE OF ANY DEFECTS THEREIN, WHETHER LATENT OR PATENT. NO
WARRANTY IS MADE ON THE BASIS OF TRADE USAGE, COURSE OF
DEALING OR COURSE OF TRADE.


1.5. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NVIDIA AND ITS
AFFILIATES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY (I) SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR (II) DAMAGES FOR (A) ANY
LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF DATA OR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
OR THE COSTS OF PROCURING SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS, ARISING OUT OF
OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OR PERFORMANCE
OF THE SDK, WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY ARISES FROM ANY CLAIM BASED
UPON BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER CAUSE OF ACTION OR
THEORY OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT WILL NVIDIA’S AND ITS AFFILIATES
TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY UNDER OR ARISING OUT OF THIS
AGREEMENT EXCEED US$10.00. THE NATURE OF THE LIABILITY OR THE
NUMBER OF CLAIMS OR SUITS SHALL NOT ENLARGE OR EXTEND THIS
LIMIT.

These exclusions and limitations of liability shall apply
regardless if NVIDIA or its affiliates have been advised of
the possibility of such damages, and regardless of whether a
remedy fails its essential purpose. These exclusions and
limitations of liability form an essential basis of the
bargain between the parties, and, absent any of these
exclusions or limitations of liability, the provisions of this
Agreement, including, without limitation, the economic terms,
would be substantially different.


1.6. Termination

  1. This Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by
    either you or NVIDIA as described below.

  2. If you want to terminate this Agreement, you may do so by
    stopping to use the SDK.

        immediately if you violate NVIDIA’s intellectual
        property rights);

      b. (ii) you commence or participate in any legal
        proceeding against NVIDIA with respect to the SDK; or

      c. (iii) NVIDIA decides to no longer provide the SDK in
        a country or, in NVIDIA’s sole discretion, the
        continued use of it is no longer commercially viable.

  4. Upon any termination of this Agreement, you agree to
    promptly discontinue use of the SDK and destroy all copies
    in your possession or control. Your prior distributions in
    accordance with this Agreement are not affected by the
    termination of this Agreement. Upon written request, you
    will certify in writing that you have complied with your
    commitments under this section. Upon any termination of
    this Agreement all provisions survive except for the
    license grant provisions.

    ------------
    PCRE LICENCE
    ------------
    PCRE is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
    and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.
    Release 8 of PCRE is distributed under the terms of the "BSD" licence, as
    specified below. The documentation for PCRE, supplied in the "doc"
    directory, is distributed under the same terms as the software itself. The
    basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also
    included in the distribution is a set of C++ wrapper functions, and a just-
    in-time compiler that can be used to optimize pattern matching. These are
    both optional features that can be omitted when the library is built.

1. License Agreement for NVIDIA Software Development Kits
---------------------------------------------------------


Important Notice—Read before downloading, installing,
copying or using the licensed software:
-------------------------------------------------------

This license agreement, including exhibits attached
("Agreement”) is a legal agreement between you and NVIDIA
Corporation ("NVIDIA") and governs your use of a NVIDIA
software development kit (“SDK”).

Each SDK has its own set of software and materials, but here
is a description of the types of items that may be included in
a SDK: source code, header files, APIs, data sets and assets
(examples include images, textures, models, scenes, videos,
native API input/output files), binary software, sample code,
libraries, utility programs, programming code and
documentation.

This Agreement can be accepted only by an adult of legal age
of majority in the country in which the SDK is used.

If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company
or other legal entity, you represent that you have the legal
authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, in which case
“you” will mean the entity you represent.

If you don’t have the required age or authority to accept
this Agreement, or if you don’t accept all the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, do not download, install or use
the SDK.

You agree to use the SDK only for purposes that are permitted
by (a) this Agreement, and (b) any applicable law, regulation
or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant
jurisdictions.


1.1. License


1.1.1. License Grant

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, NVIDIA hereby grants
you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license, without the
right to sublicense (except as expressly provided in this
Agreement) to:

  1. Install and use the SDK,

  2. Modify and create derivative works of sample source code
    delivered in the SDK, and

  3. Distribute those portions of the SDK that are identified
    in this Agreement as distributable, as incorporated in
    object code format into a software application that meets
    the distribution requirements indicated in this Agreement.


1.1.2. Distribution Requirements

These are the distribution requirements for you to exercise
the distribution grant:

  1. Your application must have material additional
    functionality, beyond the included portions of the SDK.

  2. The distributable portions of the SDK shall only be
    accessed by your application.

  3. The following notice shall be included in modifications
    and derivative works of sample source code distributed:
    “This software contains source code provided by NVIDIA
    Corporation.”

  4. Unless a developer tool is identified in this Agreement
    as distributable, it is delivered for your internal use
    only.

  5. The terms under which you distribute your application
    must be consistent with the terms of this Agreement,
    including (without limitation) terms relating to the
    license grant and license restrictions and protection of
    NVIDIA’s intellectual property rights. Additionally, you
    agree that you will protect the privacy, security and
    legal rights of your application users.

  6. You agree to notify NVIDIA in writing of any known or
    suspected distribution or use of the SDK not in compliance
    with the requirements of this Agreement, and to enforce
    the terms of your agreements with respect to distributed
    SDK.


1.1.3. Authorized Users

You may allow employees and contractors of your entity or of
your subsidiary(ies) to access and use the SDK from your
secure network to perform work on your behalf.

If you are an academic institution you may allow users
enrolled or employed by the academic institution to access and
use the SDK from your secure network.

You are responsible for the compliance with the terms of this
Agreement by your authorized users. If you become aware that
your authorized users didn’t follow the terms of this
Agreement, you agree to take reasonable steps to resolve the
non-compliance and prevent new occurrences.


1.1.4. Pre-Release SDK

The SDK versions identified as alpha, beta, preview or
otherwise as pre-release, may not be fully functional, may
contain errors or design flaws, and may have reduced or
different security, privacy, accessibility, availability, and
reliability standards relative to commercial versions of
NVIDIA software and materials. Use of a pre-release SDK may
result in unexpected results, loss of data, project delays or
other unpredictable damage or loss.

You may use a pre-release SDK at your own risk, understanding
that pre-release SDKs are not intended for use in production
or business-critical systems.

NVIDIA may choose not to make available a commercial version
of any pre-release SDK. NVIDIA may also choose to abandon
development and terminate the availability of a pre-release
SDK at any time without liability.


1.1.5. Updates

NVIDIA may, at its option, make available patches, workarounds
or other updates to this SDK. Unless the updates are provided
with their separate governing terms, they are deemed part of
the SDK licensed to you as provided in this Agreement. You
agree that the form and content of the SDK that NVIDIA
provides may change without prior notice to you. While NVIDIA
generally maintains compatibility between versions, NVIDIA may
in some cases make changes that introduce incompatibilities in
future versions of the SDK.


1.1.6. Components Under Other Licenses

The SDK may come bundled with, or otherwise include or be
distributed with, NVIDIA or third-party components with
separate legal notices or terms as may be described in
proprietary notices accompanying the SDK. If and to the extent
there is a conflict between the terms in this Agreement and
the license terms associated with the component, the license
terms associated with the components control only to the
extent necessary to resolve the conflict.

Subject to the other terms of this Agreement, you may use the
SDK to develop and test applications released under Open
Source Initiative (OSI) approved open source software
licenses.


1.1.7. Reservation of Rights

NVIDIA reserves all rights, title, and interest in and to the
SDK, not expressly granted to you under this Agreement.


1.2. Limitations

The following license limitations apply to your use of the
SDK:

  1. You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble,
    or remove copyright or other proprietary notices from any
    portion of the SDK or copies of the SDK.

  2. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, you may
    not copy, sell, rent, sublicense, transfer, distribute,
    modify, or create derivative works of any portion of the
    SDK. For clarity, you may not distribute or sublicense the
    SDK as a stand-alone product.

  3. Unless you have an agreement with NVIDIA for this
    purpose, you may not indicate that an application created
    with the SDK is sponsored or endorsed by NVIDIA.

  4. You may not bypass, disable, or circumvent any
    encryption, security, digital rights management or
    authentication mechanism in the SDK.

  5. You may not use the SDK in any manner that would cause it
    to become subject to an open source software license. As
    examples, licenses that require as a condition of use,
    modification, and/or distribution that the SDK be:

      a. Disclosed or distributed in source code form;

      b. Licensed for the purpose of making derivative works;
        or

      c. Redistributable at no charge.

  6.  You acknowledge that the SDK as delivered is not tested
    or certified by NVIDIA for use in connection with the
    design, construction, maintenance, and/or operation of any
    system where the use or failure of such system could
    result in a situation that threatens the safety of human
    life or results in catastrophic damages (each, a "Critical
    Application"). Examples of Critical Applications include
    use in avionics, navigation, autonomous vehicle
    applications, ai solutions for automotive products,
    military, medical, life support or other life critical
    applications. NVIDIA shall not be liable to you or any
    third party, in whole or in part, for any claims or
    damages arising from such uses. You are solely responsible
    for ensuring that any product or service developed with
    the SDK as a whole includes sufficient features to comply
    with all applicable legal and regulatory standards and
    requirements.

  7.  You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless NVIDIA
    and its affiliates, and their respective employees,
    contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and
    against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses,
    liabilities, costs or debt, fines, restitutions and
    expenses (including but not limited to attorney’s fees
    and costs incident to establishing the right of
    indemnification) arising out of or related to products or
    services that use the SDK in or for Critical Applications,
    and for use of the SDK outside of the scope of this
    Agreement or not in compliance with its terms.

  8. You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble
    any portion of the output generated using SDK elements for
    the purpose of translating such output artifacts to target
    a non-NVIDIA platform.


1.3. Ownership

  1.  NVIDIA or its licensors hold all rights, title and
    interest in and to the SDK and its modifications and
    derivative works, including their respective intellectual
    property rights, subject to your rights under Section

NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER CAUSE OF ACTION OR
THEORY OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT WILL NVIDIA’S AND ITS AFFILIATES
TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY UNDER OR ARISING OUT OF THIS
AGREEMENT EXCEED US$10.00. THE NATURE OF THE LIABILITY OR THE
NUMBER OF CLAIMS OR SUITS SHALL NOT ENLARGE OR EXTEND THIS
LIMIT.

These exclusions and limitations of liability shall apply
regardless if NVIDIA or its affiliates have been advised of
the possibility of such damages, and regardless of whether a
remedy fails its essential purpose. These exclusions and
limitations of liability form an essential basis of the
bargain between the parties, and, absent any of these
exclusions or limitations of liability, the provisions of this
Agreement, including, without limitation, the economic terms,
would be substantially different.


1.6. Termination

  1. This Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by
    either you or NVIDIA as described below.

  2. If you want to terminate this Agreement, you may do so by
    stopping to use the SDK.

  3. NVIDIA may, at any time, terminate this Agreement if:

      a. (i) you fail to comply with any term of this
        Agreement and the non-compliance is not fixed within
        thirty (30) days following notice from NVIDIA (or
        immediately if you violate NVIDIA’s intellectual
        property rights);

      b. (ii) you commence or participate in any legal
        proceeding against NVIDIA with respect to the SDK; or

      c. (iii) NVIDIA decides to no longer provide the SDK in
        a country or, in NVIDIA’s sole discretion, the
        continued use of it is no longer commercially viable.

  4. Upon any termination of this Agreement, you agree to
    promptly discontinue use of the SDK and destroy all copies
    in your possession or control. Your prior distributions in
    accordance with this Agreement are not affected by the
    termination of this Agreement. Upon written request, you
    will certify in writing that you have complied with your
    commitments under this section. Upon any termination of
    this Agreement all provisions survive except for the
    license grant provisions.


1.7. General

If you wish to assign this Agreement or your rights and
obligations, including by merger, consolidation, dissolution
or operation of law, contact NVIDIA to ask for permission. Any
attempted assignment not approved by NVIDIA in writing shall
be void and of no effect. NVIDIA may assign, delegate or
transfer this Agreement and its rights and obligations, and if
to a non-affiliate you will be notified.

You agree to cooperate with NVIDIA and provide reasonably
requested information to verify your compliance with this
Agreement.

the United States and of the State of Delaware, without regard to the
conflicts of laws principles. The United Nations Convention on
Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is specifically
disclaimed. You agree to all terms of this Agreement in the
English language.

The state or federal courts residing in Santa Clara County,
California shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute
or claim arising out of this Agreement. Notwithstanding this,
you agree that NVIDIA shall still be allowed to apply for
injunctive remedies or an equivalent type of urgent legal
relief in any jurisdiction.

If any court of competent jurisdiction determines that any
provision of this Agreement is illegal, invalid or
unenforceable, such provision will be construed as limited to
the extent necessary to be consistent with and fully
enforceable under the law and the remaining provisions will
remain in full force and effect. Unless otherwise specified,
remedies are cumulative.

Each party acknowledges and agrees that the other is an
independent contractor in the performance of this Agreement.

1. License Agreement for NVIDIA Software Development Kits
---------------------------------------------------------


Important Notice—Read before downloading, installing,
copying or using the licensed software:
-------------------------------------------------------

This license agreement, including exhibits attached
("Agreement”) is a legal agreement between you and NVIDIA
Corporation ("NVIDIA") and governs your use of a NVIDIA
software development kit (“SDK”).

Each SDK has its own set of software and materials, but here
is a description of the types of items that may be included in
a SDK: source code, header files, APIs, data sets and assets
(examples include images, textures, models, scenes, videos,
native API input/output files), binary software, sample code,
libraries, utility programs, programming code and
documentation.

This Agreement can be accepted only by an adult of legal age
of majority in the country in which the SDK is used.

If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company
or other legal entity, you represent that you have the legal
authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, in which case
“you” will mean the entity you represent.

If you don’t have the required age or authority to accept
this Agreement, or if you don’t accept all the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, do not download, install or use
the SDK.

You agree to use the SDK only for purposes that are permitted
by (a) this Agreement, and (b) any applicable law, regulation
or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant
jurisdictions.


1.1. License


1.1.1. License Grant

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, NVIDIA hereby grants
you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license, without the
right to sublicense (except as expressly provided in this
Agreement) to:

  1. Install and use the SDK,

  2. Modify and create derivative works of sample source code
    delivered in the SDK, and

  3. Distribute those portions of the SDK that are identified
    in this Agreement as distributable, as incorporated in
    object code format into a software application that meets
    the distribution requirements indicated in this Agreement.


1.1.2. Distribution Requirements

These are the distribution requirements for you to exercise
the distribution grant:

  1. Your application must have material additional
    functionality, beyond the included portions of the SDK.

  2. The distributable portions of the SDK shall only be
    accessed by your application.

  3. The following notice shall be included in modifications
    and derivative works of sample source code distributed:
    “This software contains source code provided by NVIDIA
    Corporation.”

  4. Unless a developer tool is identified in this Agreement
    as distributable, it is delivered for your internal use
    only.

  5. The terms under which you distribute your application
    must be consistent with the terms of this Agreement,
    including (without limitation) terms relating to the
    license grant and license restrictions and protection of
    NVIDIA’s intellectual property rights. Additionally, you
    agree that you will protect the privacy, security and
    legal rights of your application users.

  6. You agree to notify NVIDIA in writing of any known or
    suspected distribution or use of the SDK not in compliance
    with the requirements of this Agreement, and to enforce
    the terms of your agreements with respect to distributed
    SDK.


1.1.3. Authorized Users

You may allow employees and contractors of your entity or of
your subsidiary(ies) to access and use the SDK from your
secure network to perform work on your behalf.

If you are an academic institution you may allow users
enrolled or employed by the academic institution to access and
use the SDK from your secure network.

You are responsible for the compliance with the terms of this
Agreement by your authorized users. If you become aware that
your authorized users didn’t follow the terms of this
Agreement, you agree to take reasonable steps to resolve the
non-compliance and prevent new occurrences.


1.1.4. Pre-Release SDK

The SDK versions identified as alpha, beta, preview or
otherwise as pre-release, may not be fully functional, may
contain errors or design flaws, and may have reduced or
different security, privacy, accessibility, availability, and
reliability standards relative to commercial versions of
NVIDIA software and materials. Use of a pre-release SDK may
result in unexpected results, loss of data, project delays or
other unpredictable damage or loss.

You may use a pre-release SDK at your own risk, understanding
that pre-release SDKs are not intended for use in production
or business-critical systems.

NVIDIA may choose not to make available a commercial version
of any pre-release SDK. NVIDIA may also choose to abandon
development and terminate the availability of a pre-release
SDK at any time without liability.


1.1.5. Updates

NVIDIA may, at its option, make available patches, workarounds
or other updates to this SDK. Unless the updates are provided
with their separate governing terms, they are deemed part of
the SDK licensed to you as provided in this Agreement. You
agree that the form and content of the SDK that NVIDIA
provides may change without prior notice to you. While NVIDIA
generally maintains compatibility between versions, NVIDIA may
in some cases make changes that introduce incompatibilities in
future versions of the SDK.


1.1.6. Components Under Other Licenses

The SDK may come bundled with, or otherwise include or be
distributed with, NVIDIA or third-party components with
separate legal notices or terms as may be described in
proprietary notices accompanying the SDK. If and to the extent
there is a conflict between the terms in this Agreement and
the license terms associated with the component, the license
terms associated with the components control only to the
extent necessary to resolve the conflict.

Subject to the other terms of this Agreement, you may use the
SDK to develop and test applications released under Open
Source Initiative (OSI) approved open source software
licenses.


1.1.7. Reservation of Rights

NVIDIA reserves all rights, title, and interest in and to the
SDK, not expressly granted to you under this Agreement.


1.2. Limitations

The following license limitations apply to your use of the
SDK:

  1. You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble,
    or remove copyright or other proprietary notices from any
    portion of the SDK or copies of the SDK.

  2. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, you may
    not copy, sell, rent, sublicense, transfer, distribute,
    modify, or create derivative works of any portion of the
    SDK. For clarity, you may not distribute or sublicense the
    SDK as a stand-alone product.

  3. Unless you have an agreement with NVIDIA for this

    life or results in catastrophic damages (each, a "Critical
    Application"). Examples of Critical Applications include
    use in avionics, navigation, autonomous vehicle
    applications, ai solutions for automotive products,
    military, medical, life support or other life critical
    applications. NVIDIA shall not be liable to you or any
    third party, in whole or in part, for any claims or
    damages arising from such uses. You are solely responsible
    for ensuring that any product or service developed with
    the SDK as a whole includes sufficient features to comply
    with all applicable legal and regulatory standards and
    requirements.

  7.  You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless NVIDIA
    and its affiliates, and their respective employees,
    contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and
    against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses,
    liabilities, costs or debt, fines, restitutions and
    expenses (including but not limited to attorney’s fees
    and costs incident to establishing the right of
    indemnification) arising out of or related to products or
    services that use the SDK in or for Critical Applications,
    and for use of the SDK outside of the scope of this
    Agreement or not in compliance with its terms.

  8. You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble
    any portion of the output generated using SDK elements for
    the purpose of translating such output artifacts to target
    a non-NVIDIA platform.


1.3. Ownership

  1.  NVIDIA or its licensors hold all rights, title and
    interest in and to the SDK and its modifications and
    derivative works, including their respective intellectual
    property rights, subject to your rights under Section

    NVIDIA’s licensors, and these licensors are intended
    third party beneficiaries that may enforce this Agreement
    with respect to their intellectual property rights.

  2.  You hold all rights, title and interest in and to your
    applications and your derivative works of the sample
    source code delivered in the SDK, including their
    respective intellectual property rights, subject to
    NVIDIA’s rights under Section 1.3.1.

  3. You may, but don’t have to, provide to NVIDIA
    suggestions, feature requests or other feedback regarding

    to the SDK. For any feedback that you voluntarily provide,
    you hereby grant NVIDIA and its affiliates a perpetual,
    non-exclusive, worldwide, irrevocable license to use,
    reproduce, modify, license, sublicense (through multiple
    tiers of sublicensees), and distribute (through multiple
    tiers of distributors) it without the payment of any

FAULTS.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NVIDIA AND
ITS AFFILIATES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
OR NATURE, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING,
BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THE
ABSENCE OF ANY DEFECTS THEREIN, WHETHER LATENT OR PATENT. NO
WARRANTY IS MADE ON THE BASIS OF TRADE USAGE, COURSE OF
DEALING OR COURSE OF TRADE.


1.5. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NVIDIA AND ITS
AFFILIATES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY (I) SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,

you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license, without the
right to sublicense (except as expressly provided in this
Agreement) to:

  1. Install and use the SDK,

  2. Modify and create derivative works of sample source code
    delivered in the SDK, and

  3. Distribute those portions of the SDK that are identified
    in this Agreement as distributable, as incorporated in
    object code format into a software application that meets
    the distribution requirements indicated in this Agreement.


1.1.2. Distribution Requirements

These are the distribution requirements for you to exercise
the distribution grant:

  1. Your application must have material additional
    functionality, beyond the included portions of the SDK.

  2. The distributable portions of the SDK shall only be
    accessed by your application.

  3. The following notice shall be included in modifications
    and derivative works of sample source code distributed:
    “This software contains source code provided by NVIDIA
    Corporation.”

  4. Unless a developer tool is identified in this Agreement
    as distributable, it is delivered for your internal use
    only.

  5. The terms under which you distribute your application
    must be consistent with the terms of this Agreement,
    including (without limitation) terms relating to the
    license grant and license restrictions and protection of
    NVIDIA’s intellectual property rights. Additionally, you
    agree that you will protect the privacy, security and
    legal rights of your application users.

  6. You agree to notify NVIDIA in writing of any known or
    suspected distribution or use of the SDK not in compliance
    with the requirements of this Agreement, and to enforce
    the terms of your agreements with respect to distributed
    SDK.


1.1.3. Authorized Users

You may allow employees and contractors of your entity or of
your subsidiary(ies) to access and use the SDK from your
secure network to perform work on your behalf.

If you are an academic institution you may allow users
enrolled or employed by the academic institution to access and
use the SDK from your secure network.

You are responsible for the compliance with the terms of this
Agreement by your authorized users. If you become aware that
your authorized users didn’t follow the terms of this
Agreement, you agree to take reasonable steps to resolve the
non-compliance and prevent new occurrences.


1.1.4. Pre-Release SDK

The SDK versions identified as alpha, beta, preview or
otherwise as pre-release, may not be fully functional, may
contain errors or design flaws, and may have reduced or
different security, privacy, accessibility, availability, and
reliability standards relative to commercial versions of
NVIDIA software and materials. Use of a pre-release SDK may
result in unexpected results, loss of data, project delays or
other unpredictable damage or loss.

You may use a pre-release SDK at your own risk, understanding
that pre-release SDKs are not intended for use in production
or business-critical systems.

NVIDIA may choose not to make available a commercial version
of any pre-release SDK. NVIDIA may also choose to abandon
development and terminate the availability of a pre-release
SDK at any time without liability.


1.1.5. Updates

NVIDIA may, at its option, make available patches, workarounds
or other updates to this SDK. Unless the updates are provided
with their separate governing terms, they are deemed part of
the SDK licensed to you as provided in this Agreement. You
agree that the form and content of the SDK that NVIDIA
provides may change without prior notice to you. While NVIDIA
generally maintains compatibility between versions, NVIDIA may
in some cases make changes that introduce incompatibilities in
future versions of the SDK.


1.1.6. Components Under Other Licenses

The SDK may come bundled with, or otherwise include or be
distributed with, NVIDIA or third-party components with
separate legal notices or terms as may be described in
proprietary notices accompanying the SDK. If and to the extent
there is a conflict between the terms in this Agreement and
the license terms associated with the component, the license
terms associated with the components control only to the
extent necessary to resolve the conflict.

SDK:

  1. You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble,
    or remove copyright or other proprietary notices from any
    portion of the SDK or copies of the SDK.

  2. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, you may
    not copy, sell, rent, sublicense, transfer, distribute,
    modify, or create derivative works of any portion of the
    SDK. For clarity, you may not distribute or sublicense the
    SDK as a stand-alone product.

  3. Unless you have an agreement with NVIDIA for this
    purpose, you may not indicate that an application created
    with the SDK is sponsored or endorsed by NVIDIA.

  4. You may not bypass, disable, or circumvent any
    encryption, security, digital rights management or
    authentication mechanism in the SDK.

  5. You may not use the SDK in any manner that would cause it

ITS AFFILIATES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
OR NATURE, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING,
BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THE
ABSENCE OF ANY DEFECTS THEREIN, WHETHER LATENT OR PATENT. NO
WARRANTY IS MADE ON THE BASIS OF TRADE USAGE, COURSE OF
DEALING OR COURSE OF TRADE.


1.5. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NVIDIA AND ITS
AFFILIATES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY (I) SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR (II) DAMAGES FOR (A) ANY

NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER CAUSE OF ACTION OR
THEORY OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT WILL NVIDIA’S AND ITS AFFILIATES
TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY UNDER OR ARISING OUT OF THIS
AGREEMENT EXCEED US$10.00. THE NATURE OF THE LIABILITY OR THE
NUMBER OF CLAIMS OR SUITS SHALL NOT ENLARGE OR EXTEND THIS
LIMIT.

These exclusions and limitations of liability shall apply
regardless if NVIDIA or its affiliates have been advised of
the possibility of such damages, and regardless of whether a
remedy fails its essential purpose. These exclusions and
limitations of liability form an essential basis of the
bargain between the parties, and, absent any of these
exclusions or limitations of liability, the provisions of this
Agreement, including, without limitation, the economic terms,
would be substantially different.


1.6. Termination

    subject to the following terms and conditions:

    ------------
    PCRE LICENCE
    ------------
    PCRE is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
    and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.
    Release 8 of PCRE is distributed under the terms of the "BSD" licence, as
    specified below. The documentation for PCRE, supplied in the "doc"
    directory, is distributed under the same terms as the software itself. The
    basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also
    included in the distribution is a set of C++ wrapper functions, and a just-
    in-time compiler that can be used to optimize pattern matching. These are
    both optional features that can be omitted when the library is built.

copying or using the licensed software:
-------------------------------------------------------

This license agreement, including exhibits attached
("Agreement”) is a legal agreement between you and NVIDIA
Corporation ("NVIDIA") and governs your use of a NVIDIA
software development kit (“SDK”).

Each SDK has its own set of software and materials, but here
is a description of the types of items that may be included in
a SDK: source code, header files, APIs, data sets and assets
(examples include images, textures, models, scenes, videos,
native API input/output files), binary software, sample code,
libraries, utility programs, programming code and
documentation.

This Agreement can be accepted only by an adult of legal age
of majority in the country in which the SDK is used.

If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company
or other legal entity, you represent that you have the legal
authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, in which case
“you” will mean the entity you represent.

If you don’t have the required age or authority to accept
this Agreement, or if you don’t accept all the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, do not download, install or use
the SDK.

You agree to use the SDK only for purposes that are permitted
by (a) this Agreement, and (b) any applicable law, regulation
or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant
jurisdictions.


1.1. License


1.1.1. License Grant

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, NVIDIA hereby grants
you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license, without the
right to sublicense (except as expressly provided in this
Agreement) to:

  1. Install and use the SDK,

  2. Modify and create derivative works of sample source code
    delivered in the SDK, and

  3. Distribute those portions of the SDK that are identified
    in this Agreement as distributable, as incorporated in
    object code format into a software application that meets
    the distribution requirements indicated in this Agreement.


1.1.2. Distribution Requirements

These are the distribution requirements for you to exercise
the distribution grant:

  1. Your application must have material additional
    functionality, beyond the included portions of the SDK.

  2. The distributable portions of the SDK shall only be
    accessed by your application.

  3. The following notice shall be included in modifications
    and derivative works of sample source code distributed:
    “This software contains source code provided by NVIDIA
    Corporation.”

  4. Unless a developer tool is identified in this Agreement
    as distributable, it is delivered for your internal use
    only.

  5. The terms under which you distribute your application
    must be consistent with the terms of this Agreement,
    including (without limitation) terms relating to the
    license grant and license restrictions and protection of
    NVIDIA’s intellectual property rights. Additionally, you
    agree that you will protect the privacy, security and
    legal rights of your application users.

  6. You agree to notify NVIDIA in writing of any known or
    suspected distribution or use of the SDK not in compliance
    with the requirements of this Agreement, and to enforce
    the terms of your agreements with respect to distributed
    SDK.


1.1.3. Authorized Users

You may allow employees and contractors of your entity or of
your subsidiary(ies) to access and use the SDK from your
secure network to perform work on your behalf.

If you are an academic institution you may allow users
enrolled or employed by the academic institution to access and
use the SDK from your secure network.

You are responsible for the compliance with the terms of this
Agreement by your authorized users. If you become aware that
your authorized users didn’t follow the terms of this
Agreement, you agree to take reasonable steps to resolve the
non-compliance and prevent new occurrences.


1.1.4. Pre-Release SDK

The SDK versions identified as alpha, beta, preview or
otherwise as pre-release, may not be fully functional, may
contain errors or design flaws, and may have reduced or
different security, privacy, accessibility, availability, and
reliability standards relative to commercial versions of
NVIDIA software and materials. Use of a pre-release SDK may
result in unexpected results, loss of data, project delays or
other unpredictable damage or loss.

You may use a pre-release SDK at your own risk, understanding
that pre-release SDKs are not intended for use in production
or business-critical systems.

NVIDIA may choose not to make available a commercial version
of any pre-release SDK. NVIDIA may also choose to abandon
development and terminate the availability of a pre-release
SDK at any time without liability.


1.1.5. Updates

NVIDIA may, at its option, make available patches, workarounds
or other updates to this SDK. Unless the updates are provided
with their separate governing terms, they are deemed part of
the SDK licensed to you as provided in this Agreement. You
agree that the form and content of the SDK that NVIDIA
provides may change without prior notice to you. While NVIDIA
generally maintains compatibility between versions, NVIDIA may
in some cases make changes that introduce incompatibilities in
future versions of the SDK.


1.1.6. Components Under Other Licenses

The SDK may come bundled with, or otherwise include or be
distributed with, NVIDIA or third-party components with
separate legal notices or terms as may be described in
proprietary notices accompanying the SDK. If and to the extent
there is a conflict between the terms in this Agreement and
the license terms associated with the component, the license
terms associated with the components control only to the
extent necessary to resolve the conflict.

Subject to the other terms of this Agreement, you may use the
SDK to develop and test applications released under Open
Source Initiative (OSI) approved open source software
licenses.


1.1.7. Reservation of Rights

NVIDIA reserves all rights, title, and interest in and to the
SDK, not expressly granted to you under this Agreement.

SDK:

  1. You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble,
    or remove copyright or other proprietary notices from any
    portion of the SDK or copies of the SDK.

  2. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, you may
    not copy, sell, rent, sublicense, transfer, distribute,
    modify, or create derivative works of any portion of the
    SDK. For clarity, you may not distribute or sublicense the
    SDK as a stand-alone product.

  3. Unless you have an agreement with NVIDIA for this
    purpose, you may not indicate that an application created
    with the SDK is sponsored or endorsed by NVIDIA.

  4. You may not bypass, disable, or circumvent any
    encryption, security, digital rights management or
    authentication mechanism in the SDK.

  5. You may not use the SDK in any manner that would cause it
    to become subject to an open source software license. As

ITS AFFILIATES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
OR NATURE, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING,
BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THE
ABSENCE OF ANY DEFECTS THEREIN, WHETHER LATENT OR PATENT. NO
WARRANTY IS MADE ON THE BASIS OF TRADE USAGE, COURSE OF
DEALING OR COURSE OF TRADE.


1.5. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NVIDIA AND ITS
AFFILIATES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY (I) SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR (II) DAMAGES FOR (A) ANY

NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER CAUSE OF ACTION OR
THEORY OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT WILL NVIDIA’S AND ITS AFFILIATES
TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY UNDER OR ARISING OUT OF THIS
AGREEMENT EXCEED US$10.00. THE NATURE OF THE LIABILITY OR THE
NUMBER OF CLAIMS OR SUITS SHALL NOT ENLARGE OR EXTEND THIS
LIMIT.

These exclusions and limitations of liability shall apply
regardless if NVIDIA or its affiliates have been advised of
the possibility of such damages, and regardless of whether a
remedy fails its essential purpose. These exclusions and
limitations of liability form an essential basis of the
bargain between the parties, and, absent any of these
exclusions or limitations of liability, the provisions of this
Agreement, including, without limitation, the economic terms,
would be substantially different.


1.6. Termination

  1. This Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by
    either you or NVIDIA as described below.

  2. If you want to terminate this Agreement, you may do so by

    PCRE LICENCE
    ------------
    PCRE is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
    and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.
    Release 8 of PCRE is distributed under the terms of the "BSD" licence, as
    specified below. The documentation for PCRE, supplied in the "doc"
    directory, is distributed under the same terms as the software itself. The
    basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also
    included in the distribution is a set of C++ wrapper functions, and a just-
    in-time compiler that can be used to optimize pattern matching. These are
    both optional features that can be omitted when the library is built.

Important Notice—Read before downloading, installing,
copying or using the licensed software:
-------------------------------------------------------

This license agreement, including exhibits attached
("Agreement”) is a legal agreement between you and NVIDIA
Corporation ("NVIDIA") and governs your use of a NVIDIA
software development kit (“SDK”).

Each SDK has its own set of software and materials, but here
is a description of the types of items that may be included in
a SDK: source code, header files, APIs, data sets and assets
(examples include images, textures, models, scenes, videos,
native API input/output files), binary software, sample code,
libraries, utility programs, programming code and
documentation.

This Agreement can be accepted only by an adult of legal age
of majority in the country in which the SDK is used.

If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company
or other legal entity, you represent that you have the legal
authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, in which case
“you” will mean the entity you represent.

If you don’t have the required age or authority to accept
this Agreement, or if you don’t accept all the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, do not download, install or use
the SDK.

You agree to use the SDK only for purposes that are permitted
by (a) this Agreement, and (b) any applicable law, regulation
or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant
jurisdictions.


1.1. License


1.1.1. License Grant

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, NVIDIA hereby grants
you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license, without the
right to sublicense (except as expressly provided in this
Agreement) to:

  1. Install and use the SDK,

  2. Modify and create derivative works of sample source code
    delivered in the SDK, and

  3. Distribute those portions of the SDK that are identified
    in this Agreement as distributable, as incorporated in
    object code format into a software application that meets
    the distribution requirements indicated in this Agreement.


1.1.2. Distribution Requirements

These are the distribution requirements for you to exercise
the distribution grant:

  1. Your application must have material additional
    functionality, beyond the included portions of the SDK.

  2. The distributable portions of the SDK shall only be
    accessed by your application.

  3. The following notice shall be included in modifications
    and derivative works of sample source code distributed:
    “This software contains source code provided by NVIDIA
    Corporation.”

  4. Unless a developer tool is identified in this Agreement
    as distributable, it is delivered for your internal use
    only.

  5. The terms under which you distribute your application
    must be consistent with the terms of this Agreement,
    including (without limitation) terms relating to the
    license grant and license restrictions and protection of
    NVIDIA’s intellectual property rights. Additionally, you
    agree that you will protect the privacy, security and
    legal rights of your application users.

  6. You agree to notify NVIDIA in writing of any known or
    suspected distribution or use of the SDK not in compliance
    with the requirements of this Agreement, and to enforce
    the terms of your agreements with respect to distributed
    SDK.


1.1.3. Authorized Users

You may allow employees and contractors of your entity or of
your subsidiary(ies) to access and use the SDK from your
secure network to perform work on your behalf.

If you are an academic institution you may allow users
enrolled or employed by the academic institution to access and
use the SDK from your secure network.

You are responsible for the compliance with the terms of this
Agreement by your authorized users. If you become aware that
your authorized users didn’t follow the terms of this
Agreement, you agree to take reasonable steps to resolve the
non-compliance and prevent new occurrences.


1.1.4. Pre-Release SDK

The SDK versions identified as alpha, beta, preview or
otherwise as pre-release, may not be fully functional, may
contain errors or design flaws, and may have reduced or
different security, privacy, accessibility, availability, and
reliability standards relative to commercial versions of
NVIDIA software and materials. Use of a pre-release SDK may
result in unexpected results, loss of data, project delays or
other unpredictable damage or loss.

You may use a pre-release SDK at your own risk, understanding
that pre-release SDKs are not intended for use in production
or business-critical systems.

NVIDIA may choose not to make available a commercial version
of any pre-release SDK. NVIDIA may also choose to abandon
development and terminate the availability of a pre-release
SDK at any time without liability.


1.1.5. Updates

NVIDIA may, at its option, make available patches, workarounds
or other updates to this SDK. Unless the updates are provided
with their separate governing terms, they are deemed part of
the SDK licensed to you as provided in this Agreement. You
agree that the form and content of the SDK that NVIDIA
provides may change without prior notice to you. While NVIDIA
generally maintains compatibility between versions, NVIDIA may
in some cases make changes that introduce incompatibilities in
future versions of the SDK.


1.1.6. Components Under Other Licenses

The SDK may come bundled with, or otherwise include or be
distributed with, NVIDIA or third-party components with
separate legal notices or terms as may be described in
proprietary notices accompanying the SDK. If and to the extent
there is a conflict between the terms in this Agreement and
the license terms associated with the component, the license
terms associated with the components control only to the
extent necessary to resolve the conflict.

Subject to the other terms of this Agreement, you may use the
SDK to develop and test applications released under Open
Source Initiative (OSI) approved open source software
licenses.


1.1.7. Reservation of Rights

NVIDIA reserves all rights, title, and interest in and to the
SDK, not expressly granted to you under this Agreement.


1.2. Limitations

The following license limitations apply to your use of the
SDK:

  1. You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble,
    or remove copyright or other proprietary notices from any
    portion of the SDK or copies of the SDK.

  2. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, you may
    not copy, sell, rent, sublicense, transfer, distribute,
    modify, or create derivative works of any portion of the
    SDK. For clarity, you may not distribute or sublicense the
    SDK as a stand-alone product.

  3. Unless you have an agreement with NVIDIA for this
    purpose, you may not indicate that an application created
    with the SDK is sponsored or endorsed by NVIDIA.

  4. You may not bypass, disable, or circumvent any
    encryption, security, digital rights management or
    authentication mechanism in the SDK.

  5. You may not use the SDK in any manner that would cause it
    to become subject to an open source software license. As
    examples, licenses that require as a condition of use,
    modification, and/or distribution that the SDK be:

      a. Disclosed or distributed in source code form;

      b. Licensed for the purpose of making derivative works;
        or

    with all applicable legal and regulatory standards and
    requirements.

  7.  You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless NVIDIA
    and its affiliates, and their respective employees,
    contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and
    against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses,
    liabilities, costs or debt, fines, restitutions and
    expenses (including but not limited to attorney’s fees
    and costs incident to establishing the right of
    indemnification) arising out of or related to products or
    services that use the SDK in or for Critical Applications,
    and for use of the SDK outside of the scope of this
    Agreement or not in compliance with its terms.

  8. You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble
    any portion of the output generated using SDK elements for
    the purpose of translating such output artifacts to target
    a non-NVIDIA platform.


1.3. Ownership

  1.  NVIDIA or its licensors hold all rights, title and
    interest in and to the SDK and its modifications and
    derivative works, including their respective intellectual
    property rights, subject to your rights under Section
    1.3.2. This SDK may include software and materials from

    third party beneficiaries that may enforce this Agreement
    with respect to their intellectual property rights.

  2.  You hold all rights, title and interest in and to your
    applications and your derivative works of the sample
    source code delivered in the SDK, including their
    respective intellectual property rights, subject to
    NVIDIA’s rights under Section 1.3.1.

  3. You may, but don’t have to, provide to NVIDIA
    suggestions, feature requests or other feedback regarding
    the SDK, including possible enhancements or modifications
    to the SDK. For any feedback that you voluntarily provide,
    you hereby grant NVIDIA and its affiliates a perpetual,
    non-exclusive, worldwide, irrevocable license to use,
    reproduce, modify, license, sublicense (through multiple
    tiers of sublicensees), and distribute (through multiple
    tiers of distributors) it without the payment of any
    royalties or fees to you. NVIDIA will use feedback at its
    choice. NVIDIA is constantly looking for ways to improve
    its products, so you may send feedback to NVIDIA through
    the developer portal at https://developer.nvidia.com.


1.4. No Warranties

THE SDK IS PROVIDED BY NVIDIA “AS IS” AND “WITH ALL
FAULTS.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NVIDIA AND
ITS AFFILIATES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
OR NATURE, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING,
BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THE
ABSENCE OF ANY DEFECTS THEREIN, WHETHER LATENT OR PATENT. NO
WARRANTY IS MADE ON THE BASIS OF TRADE USAGE, COURSE OF
DEALING OR COURSE OF TRADE.


1.5. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NVIDIA AND ITS
AFFILIATES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY (I) SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR (II) DAMAGES FOR (A) ANY
LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF DATA OR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
OR THE COSTS OF PROCURING SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS, ARISING OUT OF
OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OR PERFORMANCE
OF THE SDK, WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY ARISES FROM ANY CLAIM BASED
UPON BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER CAUSE OF ACTION OR
THEORY OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT WILL NVIDIA’S AND ITS AFFILIATES
TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY UNDER OR ARISING OUT OF THIS
AGREEMENT EXCEED US$10.00. THE NATURE OF THE LIABILITY OR THE
NUMBER OF CLAIMS OR SUITS SHALL NOT ENLARGE OR EXTEND THIS
LIMIT.

These exclusions and limitations of liability shall apply
regardless if NVIDIA or its affiliates have been advised of
the possibility of such damages, and regardless of whether a
remedy fails its essential purpose. These exclusions and
limitations of liability form an essential basis of the
bargain between the parties, and, absent any of these
exclusions or limitations of liability, the provisions of this
Agreement, including, without limitation, the economic terms,
would be substantially different.


1.6. Termination

  1. This Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by
    either you or NVIDIA as described below.

  2. If you want to terminate this Agreement, you may do so by
    stopping to use the SDK.

        immediately if you violate NVIDIA’s intellectual
        property rights);

      b. (ii) you commence or participate in any legal
        proceeding against NVIDIA with respect to the SDK; or

      c. (iii) NVIDIA decides to no longer provide the SDK in
        a country or, in NVIDIA’s sole discretion, the
        continued use of it is no longer commercially viable.

  4. Upon any termination of this Agreement, you agree to
    promptly discontinue use of the SDK and destroy all copies
    in your possession or control. Your prior distributions in
    accordance with this Agreement are not affected by the
    termination of this Agreement. Upon written request, you
    will certify in writing that you have complied with your
    commitments under this section. Upon any termination of
    this Agreement all provisions survive except for the
    license grant provisions.

    ------------
    PCRE LICENCE
    ------------
    PCRE is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
    and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.
    Release 8 of PCRE is distributed under the terms of the "BSD" licence, as
    specified below. The documentation for PCRE, supplied in the "doc"
    directory, is distributed under the same terms as the software itself. The
    basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also
    included in the distribution is a set of C++ wrapper functions, and a just-
    in-time compiler that can be used to optimize pattern matching. These are
    both optional features that can be omitted when the library is built.

License: SMAIL-GPL
                     SMAIL GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       (Clarified 11 Feb 1988)
 .
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license, but changing it is not allowed.  You can also
 use this wording to make the terms for other programs.
 .
   The license agreements of most software companies keep you at the
 mercy of those companies.  By contrast, our general public license is
 intended to give everyone the right to share SMAIL.  To make sure that
 you get the rights we want you to have, we need to make restrictions
 that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender
 the rights.  Hence this license agreement.
 .
   Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give
 away copies of SMAIL, that you receive source code or else can get it
 if you want it, that you can change SMAIL or use pieces of it in new
 free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
 .
   To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to
 deprive anyone else of these rights.  For example, if you distribute
 copies of SMAIL, you must give the recipients all the rights that you
 have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
 source code.  And you must tell them their rights.
 .
   Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone
 finds out that there is no warranty for SMAIL.  If SMAIL is modified by
 someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what
 they have is not what we distributed, so that any problems introduced
 by others will not reflect on our reputation.
 .
   Therefore we (Landon Curt Noll and Ronald S. Karr) make the following
 terms which say what you must do to be allowed to distribute or change
 SMAIL.
 .
 .
                         COPYING POLICIES
 .
   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of SMAIL source code
 as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
 appropriately publish on each copy a valid copyright notice "Copyright
 (C) 1988 Landon Curt Noll & Ronald S. Karr" (or with whatever year is
 appropriate); keep intact the notices on all files that refer to this
 License Agreement and to the absence of any warranty; and give any
 other recipients of the SMAIL program a copy of this License
 Agreement along with the program.  You may charge a distribution fee
 for the physical act of transferring a copy.
 .
   2. You may modify your copy or copies of SMAIL or any portion of it,
 and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of
 Paragraph 1 above, provided that you also do the following:
 .
    a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
    that you changed the files and the date of any change; and
 .
    b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish,
    that in whole or in part contains or is a derivative of SMAIL or
    any part thereof, to be licensed at no charge to all third
    parties on terms identical to those contained in this License
    Agreement (except that you may choose to grant more extensive
    warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your option).
 .
    c) You may charge a distribution fee for the physical act of
    transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty
    protection in exchange for a fee.
 .
 Mere aggregation of another unrelated program with this program (or its
 derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring
 the other program under the scope of these terms.
 .
   3. You may copy and distribute SMAIL (or a portion or derivative of it,
 under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
 Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
 .
    a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,
 .
    b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal
    shipping charge) a complete machine-readable copy of the
    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of
    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,
 .
    c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the
    corresponding source code may be obtained.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for non-commercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form alone.)
 .
 For an executable file, complete source code means all the source code for
 all modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it need not include
 source code for modules which are standard libraries that accompany the
 operating system on which the executable file runs.
 .
   4. You may not copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer SMAIL
 except as expressly provided under this License Agreement.  Any attempt
 otherwise to copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer SMAIL is void and
 your rights to use the program under this License agreement shall be
 automatically terminated.  However, parties who have received computer
 software programs from you with this License Agreement will not have
 their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
 .
   5. If you wish to incorporate parts of SMAIL into other free
 programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to Landon
 Curt Noll & Ronald S. Karr via the Free Software Foundation at 51
 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA.  We have not yet
 worked out a simple rule that can be stated here, but we will often
 permit this.  We will be guided by the two goals of preserving the
 free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting
 the sharing and reuse of software.
 .
 Your comments and suggestions about our licensing policies and our
 software are welcome!  This contract was based on the contract made by
 the Free Software Foundation.  Please contact the Free Software
 Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301,
 USA, or call (617) 542-5942 for details on copylefted material in
 general.
 .
                         NO WARRANTY
 .
   BECAUSE SMAIL IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, WE PROVIDE ABSOLUTELY NO
 WARRANTY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE STATE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
 OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING, LANDON CURT NOLL & RONALD S. KARR AND/OR
 OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE SMAIL "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
 EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
 WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
 THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF SMAIL IS WITH
 YOU.  SHOULD SMAIL PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
 NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
 .
   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW WILL LANDON CURT NOLL &

g++-13:
This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the GNU compiler
collection, containing Ada, C, C++, D, Fortran 95, Go, Objective-C,
Objective-C++, and Modula-2 compilers, documentation, and support
libraries.  In addition, Debian provides the gm2 compiler, either in
the same source package, or built from a separate same source package.
Packaging is done by the Debian GCC Maintainers
<debian-gcc@lists.debian.org>, with sources obtained from:

  ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/releases/  (for full releases)
  svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/           (for prereleases)
  ftp://sourceware.org/pub/newlib/     (for newlib)
  git://git.savannah.gnu.org/gm2.git   (for Modula-2)

The current gcc-13 source package is taken from the git gcc-13-branch.

Changes: See changelog.Debian.gz

Debian splits the GNU Compiler Collection into packages for each language,
library, and documentation as follows:

Language       Compiler package  Library package    Documentation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ada            gnat-13          libgnat-13          gnat-13-doc
C              gcc-13                              gcc-13-doc
C++            g++-13           libstdc++6         libstdc++6-13-doc
D              gdc-13
Fortran 95     gfortran-13      libgfortran5       gfortran-13-doc
Go             gccgo-13         libgo0
Objective C    gobjc-13         libobjc4
Objective C++  gobjc++-13
Modula-2       gm2-13           libgm2

For some language run-time libraries, Debian provides source files,
development files, debugging symbols and libraries containing position-
independent code in separate packages:

Language  Sources      Development   Debugging            Position-Independent
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C++                                  libstdc++6-13-dbg  libstdc++6-13-pic
D         libphobos-13-dev

Additional packages include:

All languages:
libgcc1, libgcc2, libgcc4       GCC intrinsics (platform-dependent)
gcc-13-base                    Base files common to all compilers
gcc-13-soft-float              Software floating point (ARM only)
gcc-13-source                  The sources with patches

Ada:
libgnat-util13-dev, libgnat-util13   GNAT version library

C:
cpp-13, cpp-13-doc            GNU C Preprocessor
libssp0-dev, libssp0            GCC stack smashing protection library
libquadmath0                    Math routines for the __float128 type
fixincludes                     Fix non-ANSI header files

C, C++ and Fortran 95:
libgomp1-dev, libgomp1		GCC OpenMP (GOMP) support library
libitm1-dev, libitm1		GNU Transactional Memory Library

Biarch support: On some 64-bit platforms which can also run 32-bit code,
Debian provides additional packages containing 32-bit versions of some
libraries.  These packages have names beginning with 'lib32' instead of
'lib', for example lib32stdc++6.  Similarly, on some 32-bit platforms which
can also run 64-bit code, Debian provides additional packages with names
beginning with 'lib64' instead of 'lib'.  These packages contain 64-bit
versions of the libraries.  (At this time, not all platforms and not all
libraries support biarch.)  The license terms for these lib32 or lib64
packages are identical to the ones for the lib packages.

GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION

Version 3.1, 31 March 2009

Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that
bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that
the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.

When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of
certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled
program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of
non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the
header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.

0. Definitions.

A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime
Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an
interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
on the Runtime Library.

"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
subsequent versions published by the FSF.

"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,
modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with
the license of GCC.

"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for
input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
for producing a compiler intermediate representation.

The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in
non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,
use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
understood as starting with the output of the generators or
preprocessors.

A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or
with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
Eligible Compilation Process.

1. Grant of Additional Permission.

You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You
may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.

2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.

The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
requirements of the license of GCC.

g++-13-x86-64-linux-gnu:
This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the GNU compiler
collection, containing Ada, C, C++, D, Fortran 95, Go, Objective-C,
Objective-C++, and Modula-2 compilers, documentation, and support
libraries.  In addition, Debian provides the gm2 compiler, either in
the same source package, or built from a separate same source package.
Packaging is done by the Debian GCC Maintainers
<debian-gcc@lists.debian.org>, with sources obtained from:

  ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/releases/  (for full releases)
  svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/           (for prereleases)
  ftp://sourceware.org/pub/newlib/     (for newlib)
  git://git.savannah.gnu.org/gm2.git   (for Modula-2)

The current gcc-13 source package is taken from the git gcc-13-branch.

Changes: See changelog.Debian.gz

Debian splits the GNU Compiler Collection into packages for each language,
library, and documentation as follows:

Language       Compiler package  Library package    Documentation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ada            gnat-13          libgnat-13          gnat-13-doc
C              gcc-13                              gcc-13-doc
C++            g++-13           libstdc++6         libstdc++6-13-doc
D              gdc-13
Fortran 95     gfortran-13      libgfortran5       gfortran-13-doc
Go             gccgo-13         libgo0
Objective C    gobjc-13         libobjc4
Objective C++  gobjc++-13
Modula-2       gm2-13           libgm2

For some language run-time libraries, Debian provides source files,
development files, debugging symbols and libraries containing position-
independent code in separate packages:

Language  Sources      Development   Debugging            Position-Independent
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C++                                  libstdc++6-13-dbg  libstdc++6-13-pic
D         libphobos-13-dev

Additional packages include:

All languages:
libgcc1, libgcc2, libgcc4       GCC intrinsics (platform-dependent)
gcc-13-base                    Base files common to all compilers
gcc-13-soft-float              Software floating point (ARM only)
gcc-13-source                  The sources with patches

Ada:
libgnat-util13-dev, libgnat-util13   GNAT version library

C:
cpp-13, cpp-13-doc            GNU C Preprocessor
libssp0-dev, libssp0            GCC stack smashing protection library
libquadmath0                    Math routines for the __float128 type
fixincludes                     Fix non-ANSI header files

C, C++ and Fortran 95:
libgomp1-dev, libgomp1		GCC OpenMP (GOMP) support library
libitm1-dev, libitm1		GNU Transactional Memory Library

Biarch support: On some 64-bit platforms which can also run 32-bit code,
Debian provides additional packages containing 32-bit versions of some
libraries.  These packages have names beginning with 'lib32' instead of
'lib', for example lib32stdc++6.  Similarly, on some 32-bit platforms which
can also run 64-bit code, Debian provides additional packages with names
beginning with 'lib64' instead of 'lib'.  These packages contain 64-bit
versions of the libraries.  (At this time, not all platforms and not all
libraries support biarch.)  The license terms for these lib32 or lib64
packages are identical to the ones for the lib packages.

GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION

Version 3.1, 31 March 2009

Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that
bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that
the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.

When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of
certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled
program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of
non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the
header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.

0. Definitions.

A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime
Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an
interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
on the Runtime Library.

"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
subsequent versions published by the FSF.

"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,
modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with
the license of GCC.

"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for
input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
for producing a compiler intermediate representation.

The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in
non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,
use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
understood as starting with the output of the generators or
preprocessors.

A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or
with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
Eligible Compilation Process.

1. Grant of Additional Permission.

You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You
may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.

2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.

The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
requirements of the license of GCC.

The newlib subdirectory is a collection of software from several sources.
Each file may have its own copyright/license that is embedded in the source
file.

This list documents those licenses which are more restrictive than
a BSD-like license or require the copyright notice
to be duplicated in documentation and/or other materials associated with
the distribution.  Certain licenses documented here only apply to
specific targets.  Certain clauses only apply if you are building the
code as part of your binary.

Note that this list may omit certain licenses that
only pertain to the copying/modifying of the individual source code.
If you are distributing the source code, then you do not need to
worry about these omitted licenses, so long as you do not modify the
copyright information already in place.

gcc-13:
This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the GNU compiler
collection, containing Ada, C, C++, D, Fortran 95, Go, Objective-C,
Objective-C++, and Modula-2 compilers, documentation, and support
libraries.  In addition, Debian provides the gm2 compiler, either in
the same source package, or built from a separate same source package.
Packaging is done by the Debian GCC Maintainers
<debian-gcc@lists.debian.org>, with sources obtained from:

  ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/releases/  (for full releases)
  svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/           (for prereleases)
  ftp://sourceware.org/pub/newlib/     (for newlib)
  git://git.savannah.gnu.org/gm2.git   (for Modula-2)

The current gcc-13 source package is taken from the git gcc-13-branch.

Changes: See changelog.Debian.gz

Debian splits the GNU Compiler Collection into packages for each language,
library, and documentation as follows:

Language       Compiler package  Library package    Documentation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ada            gnat-13          libgnat-13          gnat-13-doc
C              gcc-13                              gcc-13-doc
C++            g++-13           libstdc++6         libstdc++6-13-doc
D              gdc-13
Fortran 95     gfortran-13      libgfortran5       gfortran-13-doc
Go             gccgo-13         libgo0
Objective C    gobjc-13         libobjc4
Objective C++  gobjc++-13
Modula-2       gm2-13           libgm2

For some language run-time libraries, Debian provides source files,
development files, debugging symbols and libraries containing position-
independent code in separate packages:

Language  Sources      Development   Debugging            Position-Independent
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C++                                  libstdc++6-13-dbg  libstdc++6-13-pic
D         libphobos-13-dev

Additional packages include:

All languages:
libgcc1, libgcc2, libgcc4       GCC intrinsics (platform-dependent)
gcc-13-base                    Base files common to all compilers
gcc-13-soft-float              Software floating point (ARM only)
gcc-13-source                  The sources with patches

Ada:
libgnat-util13-dev, libgnat-util13   GNAT version library

C:
cpp-13, cpp-13-doc            GNU C Preprocessor
libssp0-dev, libssp0            GCC stack smashing protection library
libquadmath0                    Math routines for the __float128 type
fixincludes                     Fix non-ANSI header files

C, C++ and Fortran 95:
libgomp1-dev, libgomp1		GCC OpenMP (GOMP) support library
libitm1-dev, libitm1		GNU Transactional Memory Library

Biarch support: On some 64-bit platforms which can also run 32-bit code,
Debian provides additional packages containing 32-bit versions of some
libraries.  These packages have names beginning with 'lib32' instead of
'lib', for example lib32stdc++6.  Similarly, on some 32-bit platforms which
can also run 64-bit code, Debian provides additional packages with names
beginning with 'lib64' instead of 'lib'.  These packages contain 64-bit
versions of the libraries.  (At this time, not all platforms and not all
libraries support biarch.)  The license terms for these lib32 or lib64
packages are identical to the ones for the lib packages.

GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION

Version 3.1, 31 March 2009

Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that
bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that
the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.

When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of
certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled
program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of
non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the
header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.

0. Definitions.

A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime
Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an
interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
on the Runtime Library.

"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
subsequent versions published by the FSF.

"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,
modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with
the license of GCC.

"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for
input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
for producing a compiler intermediate representation.

The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in
non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,
use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
understood as starting with the output of the generators or
preprocessors.

A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or
with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
Eligible Compilation Process.

1. Grant of Additional Permission.

You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You
may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.

2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.

The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
requirements of the license of GCC.

************************************

gcc-13-base:
This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the GNU compiler
collection, containing Ada, C, C++, D, Fortran 95, Go, Objective-C,
Objective-C++, and Modula-2 compilers, documentation, and support
libraries.  In addition, Debian provides the gm2 compiler, either in
the same source package, or built from a separate same source package.
Packaging is done by the Debian GCC Maintainers
<debian-gcc@lists.debian.org>, with sources obtained from:

  ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/releases/  (for full releases)
  svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/           (for prereleases)
  ftp://sourceware.org/pub/newlib/     (for newlib)
  git://git.savannah.gnu.org/gm2.git   (for Modula-2)

The current gcc-13 source package is taken from the git gcc-13-branch.

Changes: See changelog.Debian.gz

Debian splits the GNU Compiler Collection into packages for each language,
library, and documentation as follows:

Language       Compiler package  Library package    Documentation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ada            gnat-13          libgnat-13          gnat-13-doc
C              gcc-13                              gcc-13-doc
C++            g++-13           libstdc++6         libstdc++6-13-doc
D              gdc-13
Fortran 95     gfortran-13      libgfortran5       gfortran-13-doc
Go             gccgo-13         libgo0
Objective C    gobjc-13         libobjc4
Objective C++  gobjc++-13
Modula-2       gm2-13           libgm2

For some language run-time libraries, Debian provides source files,
development files, debugging symbols and libraries containing position-
independent code in separate packages:

Language  Sources      Development   Debugging            Position-Independent
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C++                                  libstdc++6-13-dbg  libstdc++6-13-pic
D         libphobos-13-dev

Additional packages include:

All languages:
libgcc1, libgcc2, libgcc4       GCC intrinsics (platform-dependent)
gcc-13-base                    Base files common to all compilers
gcc-13-soft-float              Software floating point (ARM only)
gcc-13-source                  The sources with patches

Ada:
libgnat-util13-dev, libgnat-util13   GNAT version library

C:
cpp-13, cpp-13-doc            GNU C Preprocessor
libssp0-dev, libssp0            GCC stack smashing protection library
libquadmath0                    Math routines for the __float128 type
fixincludes                     Fix non-ANSI header files

C, C++ and Fortran 95:
libgomp1-dev, libgomp1		GCC OpenMP (GOMP) support library
libitm1-dev, libitm1		GNU Transactional Memory Library

Biarch support: On some 64-bit platforms which can also run 32-bit code,
Debian provides additional packages containing 32-bit versions of some
libraries.  These packages have names beginning with 'lib32' instead of
'lib', for example lib32stdc++6.  Similarly, on some 32-bit platforms which
can also run 64-bit code, Debian provides additional packages with names
beginning with 'lib64' instead of 'lib'.  These packages contain 64-bit

GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION

Version 3.1, 31 March 2009

Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that
bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that
the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.

When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of
certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled
program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of
non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the
header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.

0. Definitions.

A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime
Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an
interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
on the Runtime Library.

"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
subsequent versions published by the FSF.

"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,
modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with
the license of GCC.

"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for
input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
for producing a compiler intermediate representation.

The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in
non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,
use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
understood as starting with the output of the generators or
preprocessors.

A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or
with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
Eligible Compilation Process.

1. Grant of Additional Permission.

You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You
may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.

2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.

The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
requirements of the license of GCC.

************************************

gcc-13-x86-64-linux-gnu:
This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the GNU compiler
collection, containing Ada, C, C++, D, Fortran 95, Go, Objective-C,
Objective-C++, and Modula-2 compilers, documentation, and support
libraries.  In addition, Debian provides the gm2 compiler, either in
the same source package, or built from a separate same source package.
Packaging is done by the Debian GCC Maintainers
<debian-gcc@lists.debian.org>, with sources obtained from:

  ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/releases/  (for full releases)
  svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/           (for prereleases)
  ftp://sourceware.org/pub/newlib/     (for newlib)
  git://git.savannah.gnu.org/gm2.git   (for Modula-2)

The current gcc-13 source package is taken from the git gcc-13-branch.

Changes: See changelog.Debian.gz

Debian splits the GNU Compiler Collection into packages for each language,
library, and documentation as follows:

Language       Compiler package  Library package    Documentation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ada            gnat-13          libgnat-13          gnat-13-doc
C              gcc-13                              gcc-13-doc
C++            g++-13           libstdc++6         libstdc++6-13-doc
D              gdc-13
Fortran 95     gfortran-13      libgfortran5       gfortran-13-doc
Go             gccgo-13         libgo0
Objective C    gobjc-13         libobjc4
Objective C++  gobjc++-13
Modula-2       gm2-13           libgm2

For some language run-time libraries, Debian provides source files,
development files, debugging symbols and libraries containing position-
independent code in separate packages:

Language  Sources      Development   Debugging            Position-Independent
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C++                                  libstdc++6-13-dbg  libstdc++6-13-pic
D         libphobos-13-dev

Additional packages include:

All languages:
libgcc1, libgcc2, libgcc4       GCC intrinsics (platform-dependent)
gcc-13-base                    Base files common to all compilers
gcc-13-soft-float              Software floating point (ARM only)
gcc-13-source                  The sources with patches

Ada:
libgnat-util13-dev, libgnat-util13   GNAT version library

C:
cpp-13, cpp-13-doc            GNU C Preprocessor
libssp0-dev, libssp0            GCC stack smashing protection library
libquadmath0                    Math routines for the __float128 type
fixincludes                     Fix non-ANSI header files

C, C++ and Fortran 95:
libgomp1-dev, libgomp1		GCC OpenMP (GOMP) support library
libitm1-dev, libitm1		GNU Transactional Memory Library

Biarch support: On some 64-bit platforms which can also run 32-bit code,
Debian provides additional packages containing 32-bit versions of some
libraries.  These packages have names beginning with 'lib32' instead of
'lib', for example lib32stdc++6.  Similarly, on some 32-bit platforms which
can also run 64-bit code, Debian provides additional packages with names
beginning with 'lib64' instead of 'lib'.  These packages contain 64-bit
versions of the libraries.  (At this time, not all platforms and not all
libraries support biarch.)  The license terms for these lib32 or lib64
packages are identical to the ones for the lib packages.

GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION

Version 3.1, 31 March 2009

Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that
bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that
the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.

When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of
certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled
program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of
non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the
header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.

0. Definitions.

A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime
Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an
interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
on the Runtime Library.

"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
subsequent versions published by the FSF.

"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,
modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with
the license of GCC.

"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for
input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
for producing a compiler intermediate representation.

The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in
non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,
use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
understood as starting with the output of the generators or
preprocessors.

A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or
with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
Eligible Compilation Process.

1. Grant of Additional Permission.

You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You
may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.

2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.

The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
requirements of the license of GCC.

The newlib subdirectory is a collection of software from several sources.
Each file may have its own copyright/license that is embedded in the source

This list documents those licenses which are more restrictive than
a BSD-like license or require the copyright notice
to be duplicated in documentation and/or other materials associated with
the distribution.  Certain licenses documented here only apply to
specific targets.  Certain clauses only apply if you are building the
code as part of your binary.

Note that this list may omit certain licenses that
only pertain to the copying/modifying of the individual source code.
If you are distributing the source code, then you do not need to
worry about these omitted licenses, so long as you do not modify the
copyright information already in place.

************************************

gcc-14-base:
This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the GNU compiler
collection, containing Ada, C, C++, D, Fortran 95, Go, Objective-C,
Objective-C++, and Modula-2 compilers, documentation, and support
libraries.  In addition, Debian provides the gm2 compiler, either in
the same source package, or built from a separate same source package.
Packaging is done by the Debian GCC Maintainers
<debian-gcc@lists.debian.org>, with sources obtained from:

  ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/releases/  (for full releases)
  svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/           (for prereleases)
  ftp://sourceware.org/pub/newlib/     (for newlib)
  git://git.savannah.gnu.org/gm2.git   (for Modula-2)

The current gcc-14 source package is taken from the git gcc-14-branch.

Changes: See changelog.Debian.gz

Debian splits the GNU Compiler Collection into packages for each language,
library, and documentation as follows:

Language       Compiler package  Library package    Documentation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ada            gnat-14          libgnat-14          gnat-14-doc
C              gcc-14                              gcc-14-doc
C++            g++-14           libstdc++6         libstdc++6-14-doc
D              gdc-14
Fortran 95     gfortran-14      libgfortran5       gfortran-14-doc
Go             gccgo-14         libgo0
Objective C    gobjc-14         libobjc4
Objective C++  gobjc++-14
Modula-2       gm2-14           libgm2
Rust           gccrs-14

For some language run-time libraries, Debian provides source files,
development files, debugging symbols and libraries containing position-
independent code in separate packages:

Language  Sources      Development   Debugging            Position-Independent
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C++                                  libstdc++6-14-dbg  libstdc++6-14-pic
D         libphobos-14-dev

Additional packages include:

All languages:
libgcc1, libgcc2, libgcc4       GCC intrinsics (platform-dependent)
gcc-14-base                    Base files common to all compilers
gcc-14-soft-float              Software floating point (ARM only)
gcc-14-source                  The sources with patches

Ada:
libgnat-util14-dev, libgnat-util14   GNAT version library

C:
cpp-14, cpp-14-doc            GNU C Preprocessor
libssp0-dev, libssp0            GCC stack smashing protection library
libquadmath0                    Math routines for the __float128 type
fixincludes                     Fix non-ANSI header files

C, C++ and Fortran 95:
libgomp1-dev, libgomp1		GCC OpenMP (GOMP) support library
libitm1-dev, libitm1		GNU Transactional Memory Library

Biarch support: On some 64-bit platforms which can also run 32-bit code,
Debian provides additional packages containing 32-bit versions of some
libraries.  These packages have names beginning with 'lib32' instead of
'lib', for example lib32stdc++6.  Similarly, on some 32-bit platforms which
can also run 64-bit code, Debian provides additional packages with names
beginning with 'lib64' instead of 'lib'.  These packages contain 64-bit
versions of the libraries.  (At this time, not all platforms and not all
libraries support biarch.)  The license terms for these lib32 or lib64
packages are identical to the ones for the lib packages.

GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION

Version 3.1, 31 March 2009

Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that
bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that
the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.

When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of
certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled
program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of
non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the
header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.

0. Definitions.

A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime
Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an
interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
on the Runtime Library.

"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
subsequent versions published by the FSF.

"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,
modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with
the license of GCC.

"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for
input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
for producing a compiler intermediate representation.

The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in
non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,
use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
understood as starting with the output of the generators or
preprocessors.

A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or
with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
Eligible Compilation Process.

1. Grant of Additional Permission.

You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You
may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.

2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.

The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
requirements of the license of GCC.

specific targets.  Certain clauses only apply if you are building the
code as part of your binary.

Note that this list may omit certain licenses that
only pertain to the copying/modifying of the individual source code.

libapt-pkg6.0t64:
Format: https://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/copyright-format/1.0/
Upstream-Name: apt
Upstream-Contact: APT Development Team <deity@lists.debian.org>
Source: https://salsa.debian.org/apt-team/apt
Comment:
 APT is an old software with lots of contributors over its lifetime. This
 file is a best effort to document the statements of copyright and licenses
 as stated in the file, but is not a complete representation of all copyright
 holders - those have been lost to times.
 .
 Several bits of apt-pkg/contrib have had public domain dedications but
 contributions from authors in countries not recognizing a public domain
 concept. We believe that these contributions have been done in good faith,
 and we treat them as if they had been made under the GPL-2+ as we believe
 some contributors may have missed these facts and the overall license statement
 for the project has always been GPL-2+, so we cannot be sure that contributors
 meant to grant additional permissions.
 .
 Translation files are considered to generally be GPL-2+,
 but they also include strings used by methods/rsh.cc which appears to be GPL-2.
 As the translations are split into separate domains later on,
 these strings are not loaded by library users outside of apt
 (they are in the 'apt' translation domain).
 .
 The apt-pkg/contrib/fileutl.cc file states "RunScripts()" is "GPLv2".
 We believe that this was not meant to exclude later versions of the GPL,
 as that would have changed the overall project license.

Comment:
 This file stated:
 Licensed under the GNU General Public License v2 [no exception clauses]
 .
 We believe that this was intended to be not a statement against future
 versions of the GPL, but meant to exclude the Qt license exception in
 place in APT until that time.
 .
 We received permission from Ben in 2021 to relicense under GPL-2+,
 contributions from Adam Heath and Daniel Hartwig may still have to
 be considered GPL-2 for the time being.
 .
 Other contributions are GPL-2+

************************************

libasan8:
This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the GNU compiler
collection, containing Ada, C, C++, D, Fortran 95, Go, Objective-C,
Objective-C++, and Modula-2 compilers, documentation, and support
libraries.  In addition, Debian provides the gm2 compiler, either in
the same source package, or built from a separate same source package.
Packaging is done by the Debian GCC Maintainers
<debian-gcc@lists.debian.org>, with sources obtained from:

  ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/releases/  (for full releases)
  svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/           (for prereleases)
  ftp://sourceware.org/pub/newlib/     (for newlib)
  git://git.savannah.gnu.org/gm2.git   (for Modula-2)

The current gcc-14 source package is taken from the git gcc-14-branch.

Changes: See changelog.Debian.gz

Debian splits the GNU Compiler Collection into packages for each language,
library, and documentation as follows:

Language       Compiler package  Library package    Documentation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ada            gnat-14          libgnat-14          gnat-14-doc
C              gcc-14                              gcc-14-doc
C++            g++-14           libstdc++6         libstdc++6-14-doc
D              gdc-14
Fortran 95     gfortran-14      libgfortran5       gfortran-14-doc
Go             gccgo-14         libgo0
Objective C    gobjc-14         libobjc4
Objective C++  gobjc++-14
Modula-2       gm2-14           libgm2
Rust           gccrs-14

For some language run-time libraries, Debian provides source files,
development files, debugging symbols and libraries containing position-
independent code in separate packages:

Language  Sources      Development   Debugging            Position-Independent
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C++                                  libstdc++6-14-dbg  libstdc++6-14-pic
D         libphobos-14-dev

Additional packages include:

All languages:
libgcc1, libgcc2, libgcc4       GCC intrinsics (platform-dependent)
gcc-14-base                    Base files common to all compilers
gcc-14-soft-float              Software floating point (ARM only)
gcc-14-source                  The sources with patches

Ada:
libgnat-util14-dev, libgnat-util14   GNAT version library

C:
cpp-14, cpp-14-doc            GNU C Preprocessor
libssp0-dev, libssp0            GCC stack smashing protection library
libquadmath0                    Math routines for the __float128 type
fixincludes                     Fix non-ANSI header files

C, C++ and Fortran 95:
libgomp1-dev, libgomp1		GCC OpenMP (GOMP) support library
libitm1-dev, libitm1		GNU Transactional Memory Library

Biarch support: On some 64-bit platforms which can also run 32-bit code,
Debian provides additional packages containing 32-bit versions of some
libraries.  These packages have names beginning with 'lib32' instead of
'lib', for example lib32stdc++6.  Similarly, on some 32-bit platforms which
can also run 64-bit code, Debian provides additional packages with names
beginning with 'lib64' instead of 'lib'.  These packages contain 64-bit
versions of the libraries.  (At this time, not all platforms and not all
libraries support biarch.)  The license terms for these lib32 or lib64
packages are identical to the ones for the lib packages.

GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION

Version 3.1, 31 March 2009

Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that
bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that
the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.

When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of
certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled
program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of
non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the
header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.

0. Definitions.

A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime
Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an
interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
on the Runtime Library.

"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
subsequent versions published by the FSF.

"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,
modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with
the license of GCC.

"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for
input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
for producing a compiler intermediate representation.

The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in
non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,
use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
understood as starting with the output of the generators or
preprocessors.

A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or
with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
Eligible Compilation Process.

1. Grant of Additional Permission.

You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You
may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.

2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.

The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
requirements of the license of GCC.

The newlib subdirectory is a collection of software from several sources.
Each file may have its own copyright/license that is embedded in the source
file.

This list documents those licenses which are more restrictive than
a BSD-like license or require the copyright notice
to be duplicated in documentation and/or other materials associated with
the distribution.  Certain licenses documented here only apply to
specific targets.  Certain clauses only apply if you are building the
code as part of your binary.

Note that this list may omit certain licenses that
only pertain to the copying/modifying of the individual source code.
If you are distributing the source code, then you do not need to
worry about these omitted licenses, so long as you do not modify the
copyright information already in place.

libatomic1:
This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the GNU compiler
collection, containing Ada, C, C++, D, Fortran 95, Go, Objective-C,
Objective-C++, and Modula-2 compilers, documentation, and support
libraries.  In addition, Debian provides the gm2 compiler, either in
the same source package, or built from a separate same source package.
Packaging is done by the Debian GCC Maintainers
<debian-gcc@lists.debian.org>, with sources obtained from:

  ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/releases/  (for full releases)
  svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/           (for prereleases)
  ftp://sourceware.org/pub/newlib/     (for newlib)
  git://git.savannah.gnu.org/gm2.git   (for Modula-2)

The current gcc-14 source package is taken from the git gcc-14-branch.

Changes: See changelog.Debian.gz

Debian splits the GNU Compiler Collection into packages for each language,
library, and documentation as follows:

Language       Compiler package  Library package    Documentation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ada            gnat-14          libgnat-14          gnat-14-doc
C              gcc-14                              gcc-14-doc
C++            g++-14           libstdc++6         libstdc++6-14-doc
D              gdc-14
Fortran 95     gfortran-14      libgfortran5       gfortran-14-doc
Go             gccgo-14         libgo0
Objective C    gobjc-14         libobjc4
Objective C++  gobjc++-14
Modula-2       gm2-14           libgm2
Rust           gccrs-14

For some language run-time libraries, Debian provides source files,
development files, debugging symbols and libraries containing position-
independent code in separate packages:

Language  Sources      Development   Debugging            Position-Independent
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C++                                  libstdc++6-14-dbg  libstdc++6-14-pic
D         libphobos-14-dev

Additional packages include:

All languages:
libgcc1, libgcc2, libgcc4       GCC intrinsics (platform-dependent)
gcc-14-base                    Base files common to all compilers
gcc-14-soft-float              Software floating point (ARM only)
gcc-14-source                  The sources with patches

Ada:
libgnat-util14-dev, libgnat-util14   GNAT version library

C:
cpp-14, cpp-14-doc            GNU C Preprocessor
libssp0-dev, libssp0            GCC stack smashing protection library
libquadmath0                    Math routines for the __float128 type
fixincludes                     Fix non-ANSI header files

C, C++ and Fortran 95:
libgomp1-dev, libgomp1		GCC OpenMP (GOMP) support library
libitm1-dev, libitm1		GNU Transactional Memory Library

Biarch support: On some 64-bit platforms which can also run 32-bit code,
Debian provides additional packages containing 32-bit versions of some
libraries.  These packages have names beginning with 'lib32' instead of
'lib', for example lib32stdc++6.  Similarly, on some 32-bit platforms which
can also run 64-bit code, Debian provides additional packages with names
beginning with 'lib64' instead of 'lib'.  These packages contain 64-bit
versions of the libraries.  (At this time, not all platforms and not all
libraries support biarch.)  The license terms for these lib32 or lib64
packages are identical to the ones for the lib packages.

GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION

Version 3.1, 31 March 2009

Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that
bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that
the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.

When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of
certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled
program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of
non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the
header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.

0. Definitions.

A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime
Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an
interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
on the Runtime Library.

"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
subsequent versions published by the FSF.

"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,
modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with
the license of GCC.

"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for
input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
for producing a compiler intermediate representation.

The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in
non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,
use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
understood as starting with the output of the generators or
preprocessors.

A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or
with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
Eligible Compilation Process.

1. Grant of Additional Permission.

You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You
may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.

2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.

The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
requirements of the license of GCC.

specific targets.  Certain clauses only apply if you are building the
code as part of your binary.

Note that this list may omit certain licenses that
only pertain to the copying/modifying of the individual source code.

       otherwise, you must put a sentence like this

         Regular expression support is provided by the PCRE library package,
         which is open source software, written by Philip Hazel, and copyright
         by the University of Cambridge, England.

       somewhere reasonably visible in your documentation and in any relevant

       intended to apply to whole chains of software. If package A includes PCRE,
       it must acknowledge it, but if package B is software that includes package
       A, the condition is not imposed on package B (unless it uses PCRE

    3. Altered versions must be plainly marked as such, and must not be

    4. If PCRE is embedded in any software that is released under the GNU

    2. The origin of this software must not be misrepresented, either by

       otherwise, you must put a sentence like this

         Regular expression support is provided by the PCRE library package,
         which is open source software, written by Philip Hazel, and copyright
         by the University of Cambridge, England.

       somewhere reasonably visible in your documentation and in any relevant

       intended to apply to whole chains of software. If package A includes PCRE,
       it must acknowledge it, but if package B is software that includes package
       A, the condition is not imposed on package B (unless it uses PCRE
       independently).

    3. Altered versions must be plainly marked as such, and must not be

    4. If PCRE is embedded in any software that is released under the GNU

libcc1-0:
This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the GNU compiler
collection, containing Ada, C, C++, D, Fortran 95, Go, Objective-C,
Objective-C++, and Modula-2 compilers, documentation, and support
libraries.  In addition, Debian provides the gm2 compiler, either in
the same source package, or built from a separate same source package.
Packaging is done by the Debian GCC Maintainers
<debian-gcc@lists.debian.org>, with sources obtained from:

  ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/releases/  (for full releases)
  svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/           (for prereleases)
  ftp://sourceware.org/pub/newlib/     (for newlib)
  git://git.savannah.gnu.org/gm2.git   (for Modula-2)

The current gcc-14 source package is taken from the git gcc-14-branch.

Changes: See changelog.Debian.gz

Debian splits the GNU Compiler Collection into packages for each language,
library, and documentation as follows:

Language       Compiler package  Library package    Documentation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ada            gnat-14          libgnat-14          gnat-14-doc
C              gcc-14                              gcc-14-doc
C++            g++-14           libstdc++6         libstdc++6-14-doc
D              gdc-14
Fortran 95     gfortran-14      libgfortran5       gfortran-14-doc
Go             gccgo-14         libgo0
Objective C    gobjc-14         libobjc4
Objective C++  gobjc++-14
Modula-2       gm2-14           libgm2
Rust           gccrs-14

For some language run-time libraries, Debian provides source files,
development files, debugging symbols and libraries containing position-
independent code in separate packages:

Language  Sources      Development   Debugging            Position-Independent
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C++                                  libstdc++6-14-dbg  libstdc++6-14-pic
D         libphobos-14-dev

Additional packages include:

All languages:
libgcc1, libgcc2, libgcc4       GCC intrinsics (platform-dependent)
gcc-14-base                    Base files common to all compilers
gcc-14-soft-float              Software floating point (ARM only)
gcc-14-source                  The sources with patches

Ada:
libgnat-util14-dev, libgnat-util14   GNAT version library

C:
cpp-14, cpp-14-doc            GNU C Preprocessor
libssp0-dev, libssp0            GCC stack smashing protection library
libquadmath0                    Math routines for the __float128 type
fixincludes                     Fix non-ANSI header files

C, C++ and Fortran 95:
libgomp1-dev, libgomp1		GCC OpenMP (GOMP) support library
libitm1-dev, libitm1		GNU Transactional Memory Library

Biarch support: On some 64-bit platforms which can also run 32-bit code,
Debian provides additional packages containing 32-bit versions of some
libraries.  These packages have names beginning with 'lib32' instead of
'lib', for example lib32stdc++6.  Similarly, on some 32-bit platforms which
can also run 64-bit code, Debian provides additional packages with names
beginning with 'lib64' instead of 'lib'.  These packages contain 64-bit
versions of the libraries.  (At this time, not all platforms and not all
libraries support biarch.)  The license terms for these lib32 or lib64
packages are identical to the ones for the lib packages.

GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION

Version 3.1, 31 March 2009

Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that
bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that
the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.

When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of
certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled
program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of
non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the
header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.

0. Definitions.

A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime
Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an
interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
on the Runtime Library.

"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
subsequent versions published by the FSF.

"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,
modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with
the license of GCC.

"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for
input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
for producing a compiler intermediate representation.

The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in
non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,
use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
understood as starting with the output of the generators or
preprocessors.

A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or
with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
Eligible Compilation Process.

1. Grant of Additional Permission.

You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You
may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.

2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.

The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
requirements of the license of GCC.

The newlib subdirectory is a collection of software from several sources.
Each file may have its own copyright/license that is embedded in the source
file.

This list documents those licenses which are more restrictive than
a BSD-like license or require the copyright notice
to be duplicated in documentation and/or other materials associated with
the distribution.  Certain licenses documented here only apply to
specific targets.  Certain clauses only apply if you are building the
code as part of your binary.

Note that this list may omit certain licenses that
only pertain to the copying/modifying of the individual source code.
If you are distributing the source code, then you do not need to
worry about these omitted licenses, so long as you do not modify the
copyright information already in place.

1. License Agreement for NVIDIA Software Development Kits
---------------------------------------------------------


Important Notice—Read before downloading, installing,
copying or using the licensed software:
-------------------------------------------------------

This license agreement, including exhibits attached
("Agreement”) is a legal agreement between you and NVIDIA
Corporation ("NVIDIA") and governs your use of a NVIDIA
software development kit (“SDK”).

Each SDK has its own set of software and materials, but here
is a description of the types of items that may be included in
a SDK: source code, header files, APIs, data sets and assets
(examples include images, textures, models, scenes, videos,
native API input/output files), binary software, sample code,
libraries, utility programs, programming code and
documentation.

This Agreement can be accepted only by an adult of legal age
of majority in the country in which the SDK is used.

If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company
or other legal entity, you represent that you have the legal
authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, in which case
“you” will mean the entity you represent.

If you don’t have the required age or authority to accept
this Agreement, or if you don’t accept all the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, do not download, install or use
the SDK.

You agree to use the SDK only for purposes that are permitted
by (a) this Agreement, and (b) any applicable law, regulation
or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant
jurisdictions.


1.1. License


1.1.1. License Grant

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, NVIDIA hereby grants
you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license, without the
right to sublicense (except as expressly provided in this
Agreement) to:

  1. Install and use the SDK,

  2. Modify and create derivative works of sample source code
    delivered in the SDK, and

  3. Distribute those portions of the SDK that are identified
    in this Agreement as distributable, as incorporated in
    object code format into a software application that meets
    the distribution requirements indicated in this Agreement.


1.1.2. Distribution Requirements

These are the distribution requirements for you to exercise
the distribution grant:

  1. Your application must have material additional
    functionality, beyond the included portions of the SDK.

  2. The distributable portions of the SDK shall only be
    accessed by your application.

  3. The following notice shall be included in modifications
    and derivative works of sample source code distributed:
    “This software contains source code provided by NVIDIA
    Corporation.”

  4. Unless a developer tool is identified in this Agreement
    as distributable, it is delivered for your internal use
    only.

  5. The terms under which you distribute your application
    must be consistent with the terms of this Agreement,
    including (without limitation) terms relating to the
    license grant and license restrictions and protection of
    NVIDIA’s intellectual property rights. Additionally, you
    agree that you will protect the privacy, security and
    legal rights of your application users.

  6. You agree to notify NVIDIA in writing of any known or
    suspected distribution or use of the SDK not in compliance
    with the requirements of this Agreement, and to enforce
    the terms of your agreements with respect to distributed
    SDK.


1.1.3. Authorized Users

You may allow employees and contractors of your entity or of
your subsidiary(ies) to access and use the SDK from your
secure network to perform work on your behalf.

If you are an academic institution you may allow users
enrolled or employed by the academic institution to access and
use the SDK from your secure network.

You are responsible for the compliance with the terms of this
Agreement by your authorized users. If you become aware that
your authorized users didn’t follow the terms of this
Agreement, you agree to take reasonable steps to resolve the
non-compliance and prevent new occurrences.


1.1.4. Pre-Release SDK

The SDK versions identified as alpha, beta, preview or
otherwise as pre-release, may not be fully functional, may
contain errors or design flaws, and may have reduced or
different security, privacy, accessibility, availability, and
reliability standards relative to commercial versions of
NVIDIA software and materials. Use of a pre-release SDK may
result in unexpected results, loss of data, project delays or
other unpredictable damage or loss.

You may use a pre-release SDK at your own risk, understanding
that pre-release SDKs are not intended for use in production
or business-critical systems.

NVIDIA may choose not to make available a commercial version
of any pre-release SDK. NVIDIA may also choose to abandon
development and terminate the availability of a pre-release
SDK at any time without liability.


1.1.5. Updates

NVIDIA may, at its option, make available patches, workarounds
or other updates to this SDK. Unless the updates are provided
with their separate governing terms, they are deemed part of
the SDK licensed to you as provided in this Agreement. You
agree that the form and content of the SDK that NVIDIA
provides may change without prior notice to you. While NVIDIA
generally maintains compatibility between versions, NVIDIA may
in some cases make changes that introduce incompatibilities in
future versions of the SDK.


1.1.6. Components Under Other Licenses

The SDK may come bundled with, or otherwise include or be
distributed with, NVIDIA or third-party components with
separate legal notices or terms as may be described in
proprietary notices accompanying the SDK. If and to the extent
there is a conflict between the terms in this Agreement and
the license terms associated with the component, the license
terms associated with the components control only to the
extent necessary to resolve the conflict.

Subject to the other terms of this Agreement, you may use the
SDK to develop and test applications released under Open
Source Initiative (OSI) approved open source software
licenses.


1.1.7. Reservation of Rights

NVIDIA reserves all rights, title, and interest in and to the
SDK, not expressly granted to you under this Agreement.

SDK:

  1. You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble,
    or remove copyright or other proprietary notices from any
    portion of the SDK or copies of the SDK.

  2. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, you may
    not copy, sell, rent, sublicense, transfer, distribute,
    modify, or create derivative works of any portion of the
    SDK. For clarity, you may not distribute or sublicense the
    SDK as a stand-alone product.

  3. Unless you have an agreement with NVIDIA for this
    purpose, you may not indicate that an application created
    with the SDK is sponsored or endorsed by NVIDIA.

  4. You may not bypass, disable, or circumvent any
    encryption, security, digital rights management or
    authentication mechanism in the SDK.

  5. You may not use the SDK in any manner that would cause it
    to become subject to an open source software license. As
    examples, licenses that require as a condition of use,
    modification, and/or distribution that the SDK be:

      a. Disclosed or distributed in source code form;

      b. Licensed for the purpose of making derivative works;
        or

      c. Redistributable at no charge.

  6.  You acknowledge that the SDK as delivered is not tested
    or certified by NVIDIA for use in connection with the
    design, construction, maintenance, and/or operation of any

    damages arising from such uses. You are solely responsible
    for ensuring that any product or service developed with
    the SDK as a whole includes sufficient features to comply
    with all applicable legal and regulatory standards and
    requirements.

  7.  You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless NVIDIA
    and its affiliates, and their respective employees,
    contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and
    against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses,
    liabilities, costs or debt, fines, restitutions and
    expenses (including but not limited to attorney’s fees
    and costs incident to establishing the right of
    indemnification) arising out of or related to products or
    services that use the SDK in or for Critical Applications,
    and for use of the SDK outside of the scope of this
    Agreement or not in compliance with its terms.

  8. You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble
    any portion of the output generated using SDK elements for
    the purpose of translating such output artifacts to target
    a non-NVIDIA platform.


1.3. Ownership

  1.  NVIDIA or its licensors hold all rights, title and
    interest in and to the SDK and its modifications and
    derivative works, including their respective intellectual
    property rights, subject to your rights under Section

    NVIDIA’s licensors, and these licensors are intended
    third party beneficiaries that may enforce this Agreement
    with respect to their intellectual property rights.

  2.  You hold all rights, title and interest in and to your
    applications and your derivative works of the sample
    source code delivered in the SDK, including their
    respective intellectual property rights, subject to
    NVIDIA’s rights under Section 1.3.1.

  3. You may, but don’t have to, provide to NVIDIA
    suggestions, feature requests or other feedback regarding
    the SDK, including possible enhancements or modifications
    to the SDK. For any feedback that you voluntarily provide,
    you hereby grant NVIDIA and its affiliates a perpetual,
    non-exclusive, worldwide, irrevocable license to use,
    reproduce, modify, license, sublicense (through multiple
    tiers of sublicensees), and distribute (through multiple
    tiers of distributors) it without the payment of any
    royalties or fees to you. NVIDIA will use feedback at its

OR NATURE, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING,
BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THE
ABSENCE OF ANY DEFECTS THEREIN, WHETHER LATENT OR PATENT. NO
WARRANTY IS MADE ON THE BASIS OF TRADE USAGE, COURSE OF
DEALING OR COURSE OF TRADE.


1.5. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NVIDIA AND ITS
AFFILIATES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY (I) SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR (II) DAMAGES FOR (A) ANY
LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF DATA OR LOSS OF GOODWILL,

NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER CAUSE OF ACTION OR
THEORY OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT WILL NVIDIA’S AND ITS AFFILIATES
TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY UNDER OR ARISING OUT OF THIS
AGREEMENT EXCEED US$10.00. THE NATURE OF THE LIABILITY OR THE
NUMBER OF CLAIMS OR SUITS SHALL NOT ENLARGE OR EXTEND THIS
LIMIT.

These exclusions and limitations of liability shall apply
regardless if NVIDIA or its affiliates have been advised of
the possibility of such damages, and regardless of whether a
remedy fails its essential purpose. These exclusions and
limitations of liability form an essential basis of the
bargain between the parties, and, absent any of these
exclusions or limitations of liability, the provisions of this
Agreement, including, without limitation, the economic terms,
would be substantially different.


1.6. Termination

  1. This Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by
    either you or NVIDIA as described below.

  2. If you want to terminate this Agreement, you may do so by

    ------------
    PCRE LICENCE
    ------------
    PCRE is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
    and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.
    Release 8 of PCRE is distributed under the terms of the "BSD" licence, as
    specified below. The documentation for PCRE, supplied in the "doc"
    directory, is distributed under the same terms as the software itself. The
    basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also
    included in the distribution is a set of C++ wrapper functions, and a just-
    in-time compiler that can be used to optimize pattern matching. These are
    both optional features that can be omitted when the library is built.

copying or using the licensed software:
-------------------------------------------------------

This license agreement, including exhibits attached
("Agreement”) is a legal agreement between you and NVIDIA
Corporation ("NVIDIA") and governs your use of a NVIDIA
software development kit (“SDK”).

Each SDK has its own set of software and materials, but here
is a description of the types of items that may be included in
a SDK: source code, header files, APIs, data sets and assets
(examples include images, textures, models, scenes, videos,
native API input/output files), binary software, sample code,
libraries, utility programs, programming code and
documentation.

This Agreement can be accepted only by an adult of legal age
of majority in the country in which the SDK is used.

If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company
or other legal entity, you represent that you have the legal
authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, in which case
“you” will mean the entity you represent.

If you don’t have the required age or authority to accept
this Agreement, or if you don’t accept all the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, do not download, install or use
the SDK.

You agree to use the SDK only for purposes that are permitted
by (a) this Agreement, and (b) any applicable law, regulation
or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant
jurisdictions.


1.1. License


1.1.1. License Grant

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, NVIDIA hereby grants
you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license, without the
right to sublicense (except as expressly provided in this
Agreement) to:

  1. Install and use the SDK,

  2. Modify and create derivative works of sample source code
    delivered in the SDK, and

  3. Distribute those portions of the SDK that are identified
    in this Agreement as distributable, as incorporated in
    object code format into a software application that meets
    the distribution requirements indicated in this Agreement.


1.1.2. Distribution Requirements

These are the distribution requirements for you to exercise
the distribution grant:

  1. Your application must have material additional
    functionality, beyond the included portions of the SDK.

  2. The distributable portions of the SDK shall only be
    accessed by your application.

  3. The following notice shall be included in modifications
    and derivative works of sample source code distributed:
    “This software contains source code provided by NVIDIA
    Corporation.”

  4. Unless a developer tool is identified in this Agreement
    as distributable, it is delivered for your internal use
    only.

  5. The terms under which you distribute your application
    must be consistent with the terms of this Agreement,
    including (without limitation) terms relating to the
    license grant and license restrictions and protection of
    NVIDIA’s intellectual property rights. Additionally, you
    agree that you will protect the privacy, security and
    legal rights of your application users.

  6. You agree to notify NVIDIA in writing of any known or
    suspected distribution or use of the SDK not in compliance
    with the requirements of this Agreement, and to enforce
    the terms of your agreements with respect to distributed
    SDK.


1.1.3. Authorized Users

You may allow employees and contractors of your entity or of
your subsidiary(ies) to access and use the SDK from your
secure network to perform work on your behalf.

If you are an academic institution you may allow users
enrolled or employed by the academic institution to access and
use the SDK from your secure network.

You are responsible for the compliance with the terms of this
Agreement by your authorized users. If you become aware that
your authorized users didn’t follow the terms of this
Agreement, you agree to take reasonable steps to resolve the
non-compliance and prevent new occurrences.


1.1.4. Pre-Release SDK

The SDK versions identified as alpha, beta, preview or
otherwise as pre-release, may not be fully functional, may
contain errors or design flaws, and may have reduced or
different security, privacy, accessibility, availability, and
reliability standards relative to commercial versions of
NVIDIA software and materials. Use of a pre-release SDK may
result in unexpected results, loss of data, project delays or
other unpredictable damage or loss.

You may use a pre-release SDK at your own risk, understanding
that pre-release SDKs are not intended for use in production
or business-critical systems.

NVIDIA may choose not to make available a commercial version
of any pre-release SDK. NVIDIA may also choose to abandon
development and terminate the availability of a pre-release
SDK at any time without liability.


1.1.5. Updates

NVIDIA may, at its option, make available patches, workarounds
or other updates to this SDK. Unless the updates are provided
with their separate governing terms, they are deemed part of
the SDK licensed to you as provided in this Agreement. You
agree that the form and content of the SDK that NVIDIA
provides may change without prior notice to you. While NVIDIA
generally maintains compatibility between versions, NVIDIA may
in some cases make changes that introduce incompatibilities in
future versions of the SDK.


1.1.6. Components Under Other Licenses

The SDK may come bundled with, or otherwise include or be
distributed with, NVIDIA or third-party components with
separate legal notices or terms as may be described in
proprietary notices accompanying the SDK. If and to the extent
there is a conflict between the terms in this Agreement and
the license terms associated with the component, the license
terms associated with the components control only to the
extent necessary to resolve the conflict.

Subject to the other terms of this Agreement, you may use the
SDK to develop and test applications released under Open
Source Initiative (OSI) approved open source software
licenses.


1.1.7. Reservation of Rights

NVIDIA reserves all rights, title, and interest in and to the
SDK, not expressly granted to you under this Agreement.


1.2. Limitations

SDK:

  1. You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble,
    or remove copyright or other proprietary notices from any
    portion of the SDK or copies of the SDK.

  2. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, you may
    not copy, sell, rent, sublicense, transfer, distribute,
    modify, or create derivative works of any portion of the
    SDK. For clarity, you may not distribute or sublicense the
    SDK as a stand-alone product.

  3. Unless you have an agreement with NVIDIA for this
    purpose, you may not indicate that an application created
    with the SDK is sponsored or endorsed by NVIDIA.

  4. You may not bypass, disable, or circumvent any
    encryption, security, digital rights management or
    authentication mechanism in the SDK.

  5. You may not use the SDK in any manner that would cause it
    to become subject to an open source software license. As

ITS AFFILIATES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
OR NATURE, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING,
BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THE
ABSENCE OF ANY DEFECTS THEREIN, WHETHER LATENT OR PATENT. NO
WARRANTY IS MADE ON THE BASIS OF TRADE USAGE, COURSE OF
DEALING OR COURSE OF TRADE.


1.5. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NVIDIA AND ITS
AFFILIATES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY (I) SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR (II) DAMAGES FOR (A) ANY

NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER CAUSE OF ACTION OR
THEORY OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT WILL NVIDIA’S AND ITS AFFILIATES
TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY UNDER OR ARISING OUT OF THIS
AGREEMENT EXCEED US$10.00. THE NATURE OF THE LIABILITY OR THE
NUMBER OF CLAIMS OR SUITS SHALL NOT ENLARGE OR EXTEND THIS
LIMIT.

These exclusions and limitations of liability shall apply
regardless if NVIDIA or its affiliates have been advised of
the possibility of such damages, and regardless of whether a
remedy fails its essential purpose. These exclusions and
limitations of liability form an essential basis of the
bargain between the parties, and, absent any of these
exclusions or limitations of liability, the provisions of this
Agreement, including, without limitation, the economic terms,
would be substantially different.


1.6. Termination

  1. This Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by
    either you or NVIDIA as described below.

  2. If you want to terminate this Agreement, you may do so by

    ------------
    PCRE LICENCE
    ------------
    PCRE is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
    and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.
    Release 8 of PCRE is distributed under the terms of the "BSD" licence, as
    specified below. The documentation for PCRE, supplied in the "doc"
    directory, is distributed under the same terms as the software itself. The
    basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also
    included in the distribution is a set of C++ wrapper functions, and a just-
    in-time compiler that can be used to optimize pattern matching. These are
    both optional features that can be omitted when the library is built.

1. License Agreement for NVIDIA Software Development Kits
---------------------------------------------------------


Important Notice—Read before downloading, installing,
copying or using the licensed software:
-------------------------------------------------------

This license agreement, including exhibits attached
("Agreement”) is a legal agreement between you and NVIDIA
Corporation ("NVIDIA") and governs your use of a NVIDIA
software development kit (“SDK”).

Each SDK has its own set of software and materials, but here
is a description of the types of items that may be included in
a SDK: source code, header files, APIs, data sets and assets
(examples include images, textures, models, scenes, videos,
native API input/output files), binary software, sample code,
libraries, utility programs, programming code and
documentation.

This Agreement can be accepted only by an adult of legal age
of majority in the country in which the SDK is used.

If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company
or other legal entity, you represent that you have the legal
authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, in which case
“you” will mean the entity you represent.

If you don’t have the required age or authority to accept
this Agreement, or if you don’t accept all the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, do not download, install or use
the SDK.

You agree to use the SDK only for purposes that are permitted
by (a) this Agreement, and (b) any applicable law, regulation
or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant
jurisdictions.


1.1. License


1.1.1. License Grant

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, NVIDIA hereby grants
you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license, without the
right to sublicense (except as expressly provided in this
Agreement) to:

  1. Install and use the SDK,

  2. Modify and create derivative works of sample source code
    delivered in the SDK, and

  3. Distribute those portions of the SDK that are identified
    in this Agreement as distributable, as incorporated in
    object code format into a software application that meets
    the distribution requirements indicated in this Agreement.


1.1.2. Distribution Requirements

These are the distribution requirements for you to exercise
the distribution grant:

  1. Your application must have material additional
    functionality, beyond the included portions of the SDK.

  2. The distributable portions of the SDK shall only be
    accessed by your application.

  3. The following notice shall be included in modifications
    and derivative works of sample source code distributed:
    “This software contains source code provided by NVIDIA
    Corporation.”

  4. Unless a developer tool is identified in this Agreement
    as distributable, it is delivered for your internal use
    only.

  5. The terms under which you distribute your application
    must be consistent with the terms of this Agreement,
    including (without limitation) terms relating to the
    license grant and license restrictions and protection of
    NVIDIA’s intellectual property rights. Additionally, you
    agree that you will protect the privacy, security and
    legal rights of your application users.

  6. You agree to notify NVIDIA in writing of any known or
    suspected distribution or use of the SDK not in compliance
    with the requirements of this Agreement, and to enforce
    the terms of your agreements with respect to distributed
    SDK.


1.1.3. Authorized Users

You may allow employees and contractors of your entity or of
your subsidiary(ies) to access and use the SDK from your
secure network to perform work on your behalf.

If you are an academic institution you may allow users
enrolled or employed by the academic institution to access and
use the SDK from your secure network.

You are responsible for the compliance with the terms of this
Agreement by your authorized users. If you become aware that
your authorized users didn’t follow the terms of this
Agreement, you agree to take reasonable steps to resolve the
non-compliance and prevent new occurrences.


1.1.4. Pre-Release SDK

The SDK versions identified as alpha, beta, preview or
otherwise as pre-release, may not be fully functional, may
contain errors or design flaws, and may have reduced or
different security, privacy, accessibility, availability, and
reliability standards relative to commercial versions of
NVIDIA software and materials. Use of a pre-release SDK may
result in unexpected results, loss of data, project delays or
other unpredictable damage or loss.

You may use a pre-release SDK at your own risk, understanding
that pre-release SDKs are not intended for use in production
or business-critical systems.

NVIDIA may choose not to make available a commercial version
of any pre-release SDK. NVIDIA may also choose to abandon
development and terminate the availability of a pre-release
SDK at any time without liability.


1.1.5. Updates

NVIDIA may, at its option, make available patches, workarounds
or other updates to this SDK. Unless the updates are provided
with their separate governing terms, they are deemed part of
the SDK licensed to you as provided in this Agreement. You
agree that the form and content of the SDK that NVIDIA
provides may change without prior notice to you. While NVIDIA
generally maintains compatibility between versions, NVIDIA may
in some cases make changes that introduce incompatibilities in
future versions of the SDK.


1.1.6. Third Party Licenses

The SDK may come bundled with, or otherwise include or be
distributed with, third party software licensed by a NVIDIA
supplier and/or open source software provided under an open
source license. Use of third party software is subject to the
third-party license terms, or in the absence of third party
terms, the terms of this Agreement. Copyright to third party
software is held by the copyright holders indicated in the
third-party software or license.

Subject to the other terms of this Agreement, you may use the
SDK to develop and test applications released under Open
Source Initiative (OSI) approved open source software
licenses.


1.1.7. Reservation of Rights

NVIDIA reserves all rights, title, and interest in and to the
SDK, not expressly granted to you under this Agreement.


1.2. Limitations

The following license limitations apply to your use of the
SDK:

  1. You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble,
    or remove copyright or other proprietary notices from any
    portion of the SDK or copies of the SDK.

  2. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, you may
    not copy, sell, rent, sublicense, transfer, distribute,
    modify, or create derivative works of any portion of the
    SDK. For clarity, you may not distribute or sublicense the
    SDK as a stand-alone product.

  3. Unless you have an agreement with NVIDIA for this
    purpose, you may not indicate that an application created
    with the SDK is sponsored or endorsed by NVIDIA.

  4. You may not bypass, disable, or circumvent any
    encryption, security, digital rights management or
    authentication mechanism in the SDK.

  5. You may not use the SDK in any manner that would cause it
    to become subject to an open source software license. As

  7. You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless NVIDIA
    and its affiliates, and their respective employees,
    contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and
    against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses,
    liabilities, costs or debt, fines, restitutions and
    expenses (including but not limited to attorney’s fees
    and costs incident to establishing the right of
    indemnification) arising out of or related to your use of
    the SDK outside of the scope of this Agreement, or not in
    compliance with its terms.


1.3. Ownership

  1.  NVIDIA or its licensors hold all rights, title and
    interest in and to the SDK and its modifications and
    derivative works, including their respective intellectual
    property rights, subject to your rights under Section
    1.3.2. This SDK may include software and materials from
    NVIDIA’s licensors, and these licensors are intended
    third party beneficiaries that may enforce this Agreement
    with respect to their intellectual property rights.

  2.  You hold all rights, title and interest in and to your
    applications and your derivative works of the sample
    source code delivered in the SDK, including their

    you hereby grant NVIDIA and its affiliates a perpetual,
    non-exclusive, worldwide, irrevocable license to use,
    reproduce, modify, license, sublicense (through multiple
    tiers of sublicensees), and distribute (through multiple
    tiers of distributors) it without the payment of any
    royalties or fees to you. NVIDIA will use feedback at its
    choice. NVIDIA is constantly looking for ways to improve
    its products, so you may send feedback to NVIDIA through
    the developer portal at https://developer.nvidia.com.


1.4. No Warranties

THE SDK IS PROVIDED BY NVIDIA “AS IS” AND “WITH ALL
FAULTS.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NVIDIA AND
ITS AFFILIATES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
OR NATURE, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING,
BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THE
ABSENCE OF ANY DEFECTS THEREIN, WHETHER LATENT OR PATENT. NO
WARRANTY IS MADE ON THE BASIS OF TRADE USAGE, COURSE OF
DEALING OR COURSE OF TRADE.


1.5. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NVIDIA AND ITS
AFFILIATES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR ANY LOST PROFITS, LOSS
OF USE, LOSS OF DATA OR LOSS OF GOODWILL, OR THE COSTS OF
PROCURING SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION
WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SDK,
WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY ARISES FROM ANY CLAIM BASED UPON BREACH
OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE),
PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER CAUSE OF ACTION OR THEORY OF
LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT WILL NVIDIA’S AND ITS AFFILIATES
TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY UNDER OR ARISING OUT OF THIS
AGREEMENT EXCEED US$10.00. THE NATURE OF THE LIABILITY OR THE
NUMBER OF CLAIMS OR SUITS SHALL NOT ENLARGE OR EXTEND THIS
LIMIT.

These exclusions and limitations of liability shall apply
regardless if NVIDIA or its affiliates have been advised of
the possibility of such damages, and regardless of whether a
remedy fails its essential purpose. These exclusions and
limitations of liability form an essential basis of the
bargain between the parties, and, absent any of these
exclusions or limitations of liability, the provisions of this
Agreement, including, without limitation, the economic terms,
would be substantially different.


1.6. Termination

  1. This Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by
    either you or NVIDIA as described below.

  2. If you want to terminate this Agreement, you may do so by
    stopping to use the SDK.

        immediately if you violate NVIDIA’s intellectual
        property rights);

      b. (ii) you commence or participate in any legal
        proceeding against NVIDIA with respect to the SDK; or

      c. (iii) NVIDIA decides to no longer provide the SDK in
        a country or, in NVIDIA’s sole discretion, the
        continued use of it is no longer commercially viable.

  4. Upon any termination of this Agreement, you agree to
    promptly discontinue use of the SDK and destroy all copies
    in your possession or control. Your prior distributions in
    accordance with this Agreement are not affected by the
    termination of this Agreement. Upon written request, you
    will certify in writing that you have complied with your
    commitments under this section. Upon any termination of
    this Agreement all provisions survive except for the
    license grant provisions.

    ------------
    PCRE LICENCE
    ------------
    PCRE is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
    and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.
    Release 8 of PCRE is distributed under the terms of the "BSD" licence, as
    specified below. The documentation for PCRE, supplied in the "doc"
    directory, is distributed under the same terms as the software itself. The
    basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also
    included in the distribution is a set of C++ wrapper functions, and a just-
    in-time compiler that can be used to optimize pattern matching. These are
    both optional features that can be omitted when the library is built.

1. License Agreement for NVIDIA Software Development Kits
---------------------------------------------------------


Important Notice—Read before downloading, installing,
copying or using the licensed software:
-------------------------------------------------------

This license agreement, including exhibits attached
("Agreement”) is a legal agreement between you and NVIDIA
Corporation ("NVIDIA") and governs your use of a NVIDIA
software development kit (“SDK”).

Each SDK has its own set of software and materials, but here
is a description of the types of items that may be included in
a SDK: source code, header files, APIs, data sets and assets
(examples include images, textures, models, scenes, videos,
native API input/output files), binary software, sample code,
libraries, utility programs, programming code and
documentation.

This Agreement can be accepted only by an adult of legal age
of majority in the country in which the SDK is used.

If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company
or other legal entity, you represent that you have the legal
authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, in which case
“you” will mean the entity you represent.

If you don’t have the required age or authority to accept
this Agreement, or if you don’t accept all the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, do not download, install or use
the SDK.

You agree to use the SDK only for purposes that are permitted
by (a) this Agreement, and (b) any applicable law, regulation
or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant
jurisdictions.


1.1. License


1.1.1. License Grant

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, NVIDIA hereby grants
you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license, without the
right to sublicense (except as expressly provided in this
Agreement) to:

  1. Install and use the SDK,

  2. Modify and create derivative works of sample source code
    delivered in the SDK, and

  3. Distribute those portions of the SDK that are identified
    in this Agreement as distributable, as incorporated in
    object code format into a software application that meets
    the distribution requirements indicated in this Agreement.


1.1.2. Distribution Requirements

These are the distribution requirements for you to exercise
the distribution grant:

  1. Your application must have material additional
    functionality, beyond the included portions of the SDK.

  2. The distributable portions of the SDK shall only be
    accessed by your application.

  3. The following notice shall be included in modifications
    and derivative works of sample source code distributed:
    “This software contains source code provided by NVIDIA
    Corporation.”

  4. Unless a developer tool is identified in this Agreement
    as distributable, it is delivered for your internal use
    only.

  5. The terms under which you distribute your application
    must be consistent with the terms of this Agreement,
    including (without limitation) terms relating to the
    license grant and license restrictions and protection of
    NVIDIA’s intellectual property rights. Additionally, you
    agree that you will protect the privacy, security and
    legal rights of your application users.

  6. You agree to notify NVIDIA in writing of any known or
    suspected distribution or use of the SDK not in compliance
    with the requirements of this Agreement, and to enforce
    the terms of your agreements with respect to distributed
    SDK.


1.1.3. Authorized Users

You may allow employees and contractors of your entity or of
your subsidiary(ies) to access and use the SDK from your
secure network to perform work on your behalf.

If you are an academic institution you may allow users
enrolled or employed by the academic institution to access and
use the SDK from your secure network.

You are responsible for the compliance with the terms of this
Agreement by your authorized users. If you become aware that
your authorized users didn’t follow the terms of this
Agreement, you agree to take reasonable steps to resolve the
non-compliance and prevent new occurrences.


1.1.4. Pre-Release SDK

The SDK versions identified as alpha, beta, preview or
otherwise as pre-release, may not be fully functional, may
contain errors or design flaws, and may have reduced or
different security, privacy, accessibility, availability, and
reliability standards relative to commercial versions of
NVIDIA software and materials. Use of a pre-release SDK may
result in unexpected results, loss of data, project delays or
other unpredictable damage or loss.

You may use a pre-release SDK at your own risk, understanding
that pre-release SDKs are not intended for use in production
or business-critical systems.

NVIDIA may choose not to make available a commercial version
of any pre-release SDK. NVIDIA may also choose to abandon
development and terminate the availability of a pre-release
SDK at any time without liability.


1.1.5. Updates

NVIDIA may, at its option, make available patches, workarounds
or other updates to this SDK. Unless the updates are provided
with their separate governing terms, they are deemed part of
the SDK licensed to you as provided in this Agreement. You
agree that the form and content of the SDK that NVIDIA
provides may change without prior notice to you. While NVIDIA
generally maintains compatibility between versions, NVIDIA may
in some cases make changes that introduce incompatibilities in
future versions of the SDK.


1.1.6. Components Under Other Licenses

The SDK may come bundled with, or otherwise include or be
distributed with, NVIDIA or third-party components with
separate legal notices or terms as may be described in
proprietary notices accompanying the SDK. If and to the extent
there is a conflict between the terms in this Agreement and
the license terms associated with the component, the license
terms associated with the components control only to the
extent necessary to resolve the conflict.

Subject to the other terms of this Agreement, you may use the
SDK to develop and test applications released under Open
Source Initiative (OSI) approved open source software
licenses.


1.1.7. Reservation of Rights

NVIDIA reserves all rights, title, and interest in and to the
SDK, not expressly granted to you under this Agreement.


1.2. Limitations

The following license limitations apply to your use of the
SDK:

  1. You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble,
    or remove copyright or other proprietary notices from any
    portion of the SDK or copies of the SDK.

  2. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, you may
    not copy, sell, rent, sublicense, transfer, distribute,
    modify, or create derivative works of any portion of the
    SDK. For clarity, you may not distribute or sublicense the
    SDK as a stand-alone product.

  3. Unless you have an agreement with NVIDIA for this
    purpose, you may not indicate that an application created
    with the SDK is sponsored or endorsed by NVIDIA.

  4. You may not bypass, disable, or circumvent any
    encryption, security, digital rights management or
    authentication mechanism in the SDK.

  5. You may not use the SDK in any manner that would cause it
    to become subject to an open source software license. As
    examples, licenses that require as a condition of use,
    modification, and/or distribution that the SDK be:

      a. Disclosed or distributed in source code form;

      b. Licensed for the purpose of making derivative works;
        or

      c. Redistributable at no charge.

  6.  You acknowledge that the SDK as delivered is not tested
    or certified by NVIDIA for use in connection with the
    design, construction, maintenance, and/or operation of any

    the SDK as a whole includes sufficient features to comply
    with all applicable legal and regulatory standards and
    requirements.

  7.  You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless NVIDIA
    and its affiliates, and their respective employees,
    contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and
    against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses,
    liabilities, costs or debt, fines, restitutions and
    expenses (including but not limited to attorney’s fees
    and costs incident to establishing the right of
    indemnification) arising out of or related to products or
    services that use the SDK in or for Critical Applications,
    and for use of the SDK outside of the scope of this
    Agreement or not in compliance with its terms.

  8. You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble
    any portion of the output generated using SDK elements for
    the purpose of translating such output artifacts to target
    a non-NVIDIA platform.


1.3. Ownership

  1.  NVIDIA or its licensors hold all rights, title and
    interest in and to the SDK and its modifications and
    derivative works, including their respective intellectual
    property rights, subject to your rights under Section
    1.3.2. This SDK may include software and materials from
    NVIDIA’s licensors, and these licensors are intended
    third party beneficiaries that may enforce this Agreement
    with respect to their intellectual property rights.

  2.  You hold all rights, title and interest in and to your
    applications and your derivative works of the sample
    source code delivered in the SDK, including their
    respective intellectual property rights, subject to
    NVIDIA’s rights under Section 1.3.1.

  3. You may, but don’t have to, provide to NVIDIA
    suggestions, feature requests or other feedback regarding
    the SDK, including possible enhancements or modifications
    to the SDK. For any feedback that you voluntarily provide,
    you hereby grant NVIDIA and its affiliates a perpetual,
    non-exclusive, worldwide, irrevocable license to use,
    reproduce, modify, license, sublicense (through multiple
    tiers of sublicensees), and distribute (through multiple
    tiers of distributors) it without the payment of any
    royalties or fees to you. NVIDIA will use feedback at its
    choice. NVIDIA is constantly looking for ways to improve
    its products, so you may send feedback to NVIDIA through
    the developer portal at https://developer.nvidia.com.


1.4. No Warranties

THE SDK IS PROVIDED BY NVIDIA “AS IS” AND “WITH ALL
FAULTS.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NVIDIA AND
ITS AFFILIATES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
OR NATURE, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING,
BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THE
ABSENCE OF ANY DEFECTS THEREIN, WHETHER LATENT OR PATENT. NO
WARRANTY IS MADE ON THE BASIS OF TRADE USAGE, COURSE OF
DEALING OR COURSE OF TRADE.


1.5. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NVIDIA AND ITS
AFFILIATES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY (I) SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR (II) DAMAGES FOR (A) ANY
LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF DATA OR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
OR THE COSTS OF PROCURING SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS, ARISING OUT OF
OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OR PERFORMANCE
OF THE SDK, WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY ARISES FROM ANY CLAIM BASED
UPON BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER CAUSE OF ACTION OR
THEORY OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT WILL NVIDIA’S AND ITS AFFILIATES
TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY UNDER OR ARISING OUT OF THIS
AGREEMENT EXCEED US$10.00. THE NATURE OF THE LIABILITY OR THE
NUMBER OF CLAIMS OR SUITS SHALL NOT ENLARGE OR EXTEND THIS
LIMIT.

These exclusions and limitations of liability shall apply
regardless if NVIDIA or its affiliates have been advised of
the possibility of such damages, and regardless of whether a
remedy fails its essential purpose. These exclusions and
limitations of liability form an essential basis of the
bargain between the parties, and, absent any of these
exclusions or limitations of liability, the provisions of this
Agreement, including, without limitation, the economic terms,
would be substantially different.


1.6. Termination

  1. This Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by
    either you or NVIDIA as described below.

  2. If you want to terminate this Agreement, you may do so by
    stopping to use the SDK.

        immediately if you violate NVIDIA’s intellectual
        property rights);

      b. (ii) you commence or participate in any legal
        proceeding against NVIDIA with respect to the SDK; or

      c. (iii) NVIDIA decides to no longer provide the SDK in
        a country or, in NVIDIA’s sole discretion, the
        continued use of it is no longer commercially viable.

  4. Upon any termination of this Agreement, you agree to
    promptly discontinue use of the SDK and destroy all copies
    in your possession or control. Your prior distributions in
    accordance with this Agreement are not affected by the
    termination of this Agreement. Upon written request, you
    will certify in writing that you have complied with your
    commitments under this section. Upon any termination of
    this Agreement all provisions survive except for the
    license grant provisions.

    ------------
    PCRE LICENCE
    ------------
    PCRE is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
    and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.
    Release 8 of PCRE is distributed under the terms of the "BSD" licence, as
    specified below. The documentation for PCRE, supplied in the "doc"
    directory, is distributed under the same terms as the software itself. The
    basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also
    included in the distribution is a set of C++ wrapper functions, and a just-
    in-time compiler that can be used to optimize pattern matching. These are
    both optional features that can be omitted when the library is built.

1. License Agreement for NVIDIA Software Development Kits
---------------------------------------------------------


Important Notice—Read before downloading, installing,
copying or using the licensed software:
-------------------------------------------------------

This license agreement, including exhibits attached
("Agreement”) is a legal agreement between you and NVIDIA
Corporation ("NVIDIA") and governs your use of a NVIDIA
software development kit (“SDK”).

Each SDK has its own set of software and materials, but here
is a description of the types of items that may be included in
a SDK: source code, header files, APIs, data sets and assets
(examples include images, textures, models, scenes, videos,
native API input/output files), binary software, sample code,
libraries, utility programs, programming code and
documentation.

This Agreement can be accepted only by an adult of legal age
of majority in the country in which the SDK is used.

If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company
or other legal entity, you represent that you have the legal
authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, in which case
“you” will mean the entity you represent.

If you don’t have the required age or authority to accept
this Agreement, or if you don’t accept all the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, do not download, install or use
the SDK.

You agree to use the SDK only for purposes that are permitted
by (a) this Agreement, and (b) any applicable law, regulation
or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant
jurisdictions.


1.1. License


1.1.1. License Grant

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, NVIDIA hereby grants
you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license, without the
right to sublicense (except as expressly provided in this
Agreement) to:

  1. Install and use the SDK,

  2. Modify and create derivative works of sample source code
    delivered in the SDK, and

  3. Distribute those portions of the SDK that are identified
    in this Agreement as distributable, as incorporated in
    object code format into a software application that meets
    the distribution requirements indicated in this Agreement.


1.1.2. Distribution Requirements

These are the distribution requirements for you to exercise
the distribution grant:

  1. Your application must have material additional
    functionality, beyond the included portions of the SDK.

  2. The distributable portions of the SDK shall only be
    accessed by your application.

  3. The following notice shall be included in modifications
    and derivative works of sample source code distributed:
    “This software contains source code provided by NVIDIA
    Corporation.”

  4. Unless a developer tool is identified in this Agreement
    as distributable, it is delivered for your internal use
    only.

  5. The terms under which you distribute your application
    must be consistent with the terms of this Agreement,
    including (without limitation) terms relating to the
    license grant and license restrictions and protection of
    NVIDIA’s intellectual property rights. Additionally, you
    agree that you will protect the privacy, security and
    legal rights of your application users.

  6. You agree to notify NVIDIA in writing of any known or
    suspected distribution or use of the SDK not in compliance
    with the requirements of this Agreement, and to enforce
    the terms of your agreements with respect to distributed
    SDK.


1.1.3. Authorized Users

You may allow employees and contractors of your entity or of
your subsidiary(ies) to access and use the SDK from your
secure network to perform work on your behalf.

If you are an academic institution you may allow users
enrolled or employed by the academic institution to access and
use the SDK from your secure network.

You are responsible for the compliance with the terms of this
Agreement by your authorized users. If you become aware that
your authorized users didn’t follow the terms of this
Agreement, you agree to take reasonable steps to resolve the
non-compliance and prevent new occurrences.


1.1.4. Pre-Release SDK

The SDK versions identified as alpha, beta, preview or
otherwise as pre-release, may not be fully functional, may
contain errors or design flaws, and may have reduced or
different security, privacy, accessibility, availability, and
reliability standards relative to commercial versions of
NVIDIA software and materials. Use of a pre-release SDK may
result in unexpected results, loss of data, project delays or
other unpredictable damage or loss.

You may use a pre-release SDK at your own risk, understanding
that pre-release SDKs are not intended for use in production
or business-critical systems.

NVIDIA may choose not to make available a commercial version
of any pre-release SDK. NVIDIA may also choose to abandon
development and terminate the availability of a pre-release
SDK at any time without liability.


1.1.5. Updates

NVIDIA may, at its option, make available patches, workarounds
or other updates to this SDK. Unless the updates are provided
with their separate governing terms, they are deemed part of
the SDK licensed to you as provided in this Agreement. You
agree that the form and content of the SDK that NVIDIA
provides may change without prior notice to you. While NVIDIA
generally maintains compatibility between versions, NVIDIA may
in some cases make changes that introduce incompatibilities in
future versions of the SDK.


1.1.6. Components Under Other Licenses

The SDK may come bundled with, or otherwise include or be
distributed with, NVIDIA or third-party components with
separate legal notices or terms as may be described in
proprietary notices accompanying the SDK. If and to the extent
there is a conflict between the terms in this Agreement and
the license terms associated with the component, the license
terms associated with the components control only to the
extent necessary to resolve the conflict.

Subject to the other terms of this Agreement, you may use the
SDK to develop and test applications released under Open
Source Initiative (OSI) approved open source software
licenses.


1.1.7. Reservation of Rights

NVIDIA reserves all rights, title, and interest in and to the
SDK, not expressly granted to you under this Agreement.


1.2. Limitations

The following license limitations apply to your use of the
SDK:

  1. You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble,
    or remove copyright or other proprietary notices from any
    portion of the SDK or copies of the SDK.

  2. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, you may
    not copy, sell, rent, sublicense, transfer, distribute,
    modify, or create derivative works of any portion of the
    SDK. For clarity, you may not distribute or sublicense the
    SDK as a stand-alone product.

  3. Unless you have an agreement with NVIDIA for this
    purpose, you may not indicate that an application created
    with the SDK is sponsored or endorsed by NVIDIA.

  4. You may not bypass, disable, or circumvent any
    encryption, security, digital rights management or
    authentication mechanism in the SDK.

  5. You may not use the SDK in any manner that would cause it
    to become subject to an open source software license. As
    examples, licenses that require as a condition of use,
    modification, and/or distribution that the SDK be:

      a. Disclosed or distributed in source code form;

      b. Licensed for the purpose of making derivative works;
        or

      c. Redistributable at no charge.

  6.  You acknowledge that the SDK as delivered is not tested
    or certified by NVIDIA for use in connection with the
    design, construction, maintenance, and/or operation of any
    system where the use or failure of such system could
    result in a situation that threatens the safety of human
    life or results in catastrophic damages (each, a "Critical
    Application"). Examples of Critical Applications include
    use in avionics, navigation, autonomous vehicle
    applications, ai solutions for automotive products,
    military, medical, life support or other life critical
    applications. NVIDIA shall not be liable to you or any
    third party, in whole or in part, for any claims or
    damages arising from such uses. You are solely responsible
    for ensuring that any product or service developed with
    the SDK as a whole includes sufficient features to comply
    with all applicable legal and regulatory standards and
    requirements.

  7.  You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless NVIDIA
    and its affiliates, and their respective employees,
    contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and
    against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses,
    liabilities, costs or debt, fines, restitutions and
    expenses (including but not limited to attorney’s fees
    and costs incident to establishing the right of
    indemnification) arising out of or related to products or
    services that use the SDK in or for Critical Applications,
    and for use of the SDK outside of the scope of this
    Agreement or not in compliance with its terms.

  8. You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble
    any portion of the output generated using SDK elements for
    the purpose of translating such output artifacts to target
    a non-NVIDIA platform.


1.3. Ownership

  1.  NVIDIA or its licensors hold all rights, title and
    interest in and to the SDK and its modifications and
    derivative works, including their respective intellectual
    property rights, subject to your rights under Section
    1.3.2. This SDK may include software and materials from
    NVIDIA’s licensors, and these licensors are intended
    third party beneficiaries that may enforce this Agreement
    with respect to their intellectual property rights.

  2.  You hold all rights, title and interest in and to your
    applications and your derivative works of the sample
    source code delivered in the SDK, including their
    respective intellectual property rights, subject to
    NVIDIA’s rights under Section 1.3.1.

  3. You may, but don’t have to, provide to NVIDIA
    suggestions, feature requests or other feedback regarding
    the SDK, including possible enhancements or modifications
    to the SDK. For any feedback that you voluntarily provide,
    you hereby grant NVIDIA and its affiliates a perpetual,
    non-exclusive, worldwide, irrevocable license to use,
    reproduce, modify, license, sublicense (through multiple
    tiers of sublicensees), and distribute (through multiple
    tiers of distributors) it without the payment of any
    royalties or fees to you. NVIDIA will use feedback at its
    choice. NVIDIA is constantly looking for ways to improve
    its products, so you may send feedback to NVIDIA through
    the developer portal at https://developer.nvidia.com.


1.4. No Warranties

THE SDK IS PROVIDED BY NVIDIA “AS IS” AND “WITH ALL
FAULTS.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NVIDIA AND
ITS AFFILIATES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
OR NATURE, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING,
BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THE
ABSENCE OF ANY DEFECTS THEREIN, WHETHER LATENT OR PATENT. NO
WARRANTY IS MADE ON THE BASIS OF TRADE USAGE, COURSE OF
DEALING OR COURSE OF TRADE.


1.5. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NVIDIA AND ITS
AFFILIATES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY (I) SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR (II) DAMAGES FOR (A) ANY
LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF DATA OR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
OR THE COSTS OF PROCURING SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS, ARISING OUT OF
OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OR PERFORMANCE
OF THE SDK, WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY ARISES FROM ANY CLAIM BASED
UPON BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER CAUSE OF ACTION OR
THEORY OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT WILL NVIDIA’S AND ITS AFFILIATES
TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY UNDER OR ARISING OUT OF THIS
AGREEMENT EXCEED US$10.00. THE NATURE OF THE LIABILITY OR THE
NUMBER OF CLAIMS OR SUITS SHALL NOT ENLARGE OR EXTEND THIS
LIMIT.

These exclusions and limitations of liability shall apply
regardless if NVIDIA or its affiliates have been advised of
the possibility of such damages, and regardless of whether a
remedy fails its essential purpose. These exclusions and
limitations of liability form an essential basis of the
bargain between the parties, and, absent any of these
exclusions or limitations of liability, the provisions of this
Agreement, including, without limitation, the economic terms,
would be substantially different.


1.6. Termination

  1. This Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by
    either you or NVIDIA as described below.

  2. If you want to terminate this Agreement, you may do so by
    stopping to use the SDK.

  3. NVIDIA may, at any time, terminate this Agreement if:

      a. (i) you fail to comply with any term of this
        Agreement and the non-compliance is not fixed within
        thirty (30) days following notice from NVIDIA (or
        immediately if you violate NVIDIA’s intellectual
        property rights);

      b. (ii) you commence or participate in any legal
        proceeding against NVIDIA with respect to the SDK; or

      c. (iii) NVIDIA decides to no longer provide the SDK in
        a country or, in NVIDIA’s sole discretion, the
        continued use of it is no longer commercially viable.

  4. Upon any termination of this Agreement, you agree to
    promptly discontinue use of the SDK and destroy all copies
    in your possession or control. Your prior distributions in
    accordance with this Agreement are not affected by the

1. License Agreement for NVIDIA Software Development Kits
---------------------------------------------------------


Important Notice—Read before downloading, installing,
copying or using the licensed software:
-------------------------------------------------------

This license agreement, including exhibits attached
("Agreement”) is a legal agreement between you and NVIDIA
Corporation ("NVIDIA") and governs your use of a NVIDIA
software development kit (“SDK”).

Each SDK has its own set of software and materials, but here
is a description of the types of items that may be included in
a SDK: source code, header files, APIs, data sets and assets
(examples include images, textures, models, scenes, videos,
native API input/output files), binary software, sample code,
libraries, utility programs, programming code and
documentation.

This Agreement can be accepted only by an adult of legal age
of majority in the country in which the SDK is used.

If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company
or other legal entity, you represent that you have the legal
authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, in which case
“you” will mean the entity you represent.

If you don’t have the required age or authority to accept
this Agreement, or if you don’t accept all the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, do not download, install or use
the SDK.

You agree to use the SDK only for purposes that are permitted
by (a) this Agreement, and (b) any applicable law, regulation
or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant
jurisdictions.


1.1. License


1.1.1. License Grant

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, NVIDIA hereby grants
you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license, without the
right to sublicense (except as expressly provided in this
Agreement) to:

  1. Install and use the SDK,

  2. Modify and create derivative works of sample source code
    delivered in the SDK, and

  3. Distribute those portions of the SDK that are identified
    in this Agreement as distributable, as incorporated in
    object code format into a software application that meets
    the distribution requirements indicated in this Agreement.


1.1.2. Distribution Requirements

These are the distribution requirements for you to exercise
the distribution grant:

  1. Your application must have material additional
    functionality, beyond the included portions of the SDK.

  2. The distributable portions of the SDK shall only be
    accessed by your application.

  3. The following notice shall be included in modifications
    and derivative works of sample source code distributed:
    “This software contains source code provided by NVIDIA
    Corporation.”

  4. Unless a developer tool is identified in this Agreement
    as distributable, it is delivered for your internal use
    only.

  5. The terms under which you distribute your application
    must be consistent with the terms of this Agreement,
    including (without limitation) terms relating to the
    license grant and license restrictions and protection of
    NVIDIA’s intellectual property rights. Additionally, you
    agree that you will protect the privacy, security and
    legal rights of your application users.

  6. You agree to notify NVIDIA in writing of any known or
    suspected distribution or use of the SDK not in compliance
    with the requirements of this Agreement, and to enforce
    the terms of your agreements with respect to distributed
    SDK.


1.1.3. Authorized Users

You may allow employees and contractors of your entity or of
your subsidiary(ies) to access and use the SDK from your
secure network to perform work on your behalf.

If you are an academic institution you may allow users
enrolled or employed by the academic institution to access and
use the SDK from your secure network.

You are responsible for the compliance with the terms of this
Agreement by your authorized users. If you become aware that
your authorized users didn’t follow the terms of this
Agreement, you agree to take reasonable steps to resolve the
non-compliance and prevent new occurrences.


1.1.4. Pre-Release SDK

The SDK versions identified as alpha, beta, preview or
otherwise as pre-release, may not be fully functional, may
contain errors or design flaws, and may have reduced or
different security, privacy, accessibility, availability, and
reliability standards relative to commercial versions of
NVIDIA software and materials. Use of a pre-release SDK may
result in unexpected results, loss of data, project delays or
other unpredictable damage or loss.

You may use a pre-release SDK at your own risk, understanding
that pre-release SDKs are not intended for use in production
or business-critical systems.

NVIDIA may choose not to make available a commercial version
of any pre-release SDK. NVIDIA may also choose to abandon
development and terminate the availability of a pre-release
SDK at any time without liability.


1.1.5. Updates

NVIDIA may, at its option, make available patches, workarounds
or other updates to this SDK. Unless the updates are provided
with their separate governing terms, they are deemed part of
the SDK licensed to you as provided in this Agreement. You
agree that the form and content of the SDK that NVIDIA
provides may change without prior notice to you. While NVIDIA
generally maintains compatibility between versions, NVIDIA may
in some cases make changes that introduce incompatibilities in
future versions of the SDK.


1.1.6. Components Under Other Licenses

The SDK may come bundled with, or otherwise include or be
distributed with, NVIDIA or third-party components with
separate legal notices or terms as may be described in
proprietary notices accompanying the SDK. If and to the extent
there is a conflict between the terms in this Agreement and
the license terms associated with the component, the license
terms associated with the components control only to the
extent necessary to resolve the conflict.

Subject to the other terms of this Agreement, you may use the
SDK to develop and test applications released under Open
Source Initiative (OSI) approved open source software
licenses.


1.1.7. Reservation of Rights

NVIDIA reserves all rights, title, and interest in and to the
SDK, not expressly granted to you under this Agreement.


1.2. Limitations

The following license limitations apply to your use of the
SDK:

  1. You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble,
    or remove copyright or other proprietary notices from any
    portion of the SDK or copies of the SDK.

  2. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, you may
    not copy, sell, rent, sublicense, transfer, distribute,
    modify, or create derivative works of any portion of the
    SDK. For clarity, you may not distribute or sublicense the
    SDK as a stand-alone product.

  3. Unless you have an agreement with NVIDIA for this
    purpose, you may not indicate that an application created
    with the SDK is sponsored or endorsed by NVIDIA.

  4. You may not bypass, disable, or circumvent any
    encryption, security, digital rights management or
    authentication mechanism in the SDK.

  5. You may not use the SDK in any manner that would cause it
    to become subject to an open source software license. As
    examples, licenses that require as a condition of use,
    modification, and/or distribution that the SDK be:

      a. Disclosed or distributed in source code form;

      b. Licensed for the purpose of making derivative works;
        or

      c. Redistributable at no charge.

  6.  You acknowledge that the SDK as delivered is not tested
    or certified by NVIDIA for use in connection with the
    design, construction, maintenance, and/or operation of any
    system where the use or failure of such system could
    result in a situation that threatens the safety of human
    life or results in catastrophic damages (each, a "Critical
    Application"). Examples of Critical Applications include
    use in avionics, navigation, autonomous vehicle
    applications, ai solutions for automotive products,
    military, medical, life support or other life critical
    applications. NVIDIA shall not be liable to you or any

    with all applicable legal and regulatory standards and
    requirements.

  7.  You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless NVIDIA
    and its affiliates, and their respective employees,
    contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and
    against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses,
    liabilities, costs or debt, fines, restitutions and
    expenses (including but not limited to attorney’s fees
    and costs incident to establishing the right of
    indemnification) arising out of or related to products or
    services that use the SDK in or for Critical Applications,
    and for use of the SDK outside of the scope of this
    Agreement or not in compliance with its terms.

  8. You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble
    any portion of the output generated using SDK elements for
    the purpose of translating such output artifacts to target
    a non-NVIDIA platform.


1.3. Ownership

  1.  NVIDIA or its licensors hold all rights, title and
    interest in and to the SDK and its modifications and
    derivative works, including their respective intellectual
    property rights, subject to your rights under Section
    1.3.2. This SDK may include software and materials from
    NVIDIA’s licensors, and these licensors are intended
    third party beneficiaries that may enforce this Agreement
    with respect to their intellectual property rights.

  2.  You hold all rights, title and interest in and to your
    applications and your derivative works of the sample
    source code delivered in the SDK, including their
    respective intellectual property rights, subject to
    NVIDIA’s rights under Section 1.3.1.

  3. You may, but don’t have to, provide to NVIDIA
    suggestions, feature requests or other feedback regarding
    the SDK, including possible enhancements or modifications
    to the SDK. For any feedback that you voluntarily provide,
    you hereby grant NVIDIA and its affiliates a perpetual,
    non-exclusive, worldwide, irrevocable license to use,
    reproduce, modify, license, sublicense (through multiple
    tiers of sublicensees), and distribute (through multiple
    tiers of distributors) it without the payment of any

    the developer portal at https://developer.nvidia.com.


1.4. No Warranties

THE SDK IS PROVIDED BY NVIDIA “AS IS” AND “WITH ALL
FAULTS.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NVIDIA AND
ITS AFFILIATES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
OR NATURE, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING,
BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THE
ABSENCE OF ANY DEFECTS THEREIN, WHETHER LATENT OR PATENT. NO
WARRANTY IS MADE ON THE BASIS OF TRADE USAGE, COURSE OF
DEALING OR COURSE OF TRADE.


1.5. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NVIDIA AND ITS
AFFILIATES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY (I) SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR (II) DAMAGES FOR (A) ANY
LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF DATA OR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
OR THE COSTS OF PROCURING SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS, ARISING OUT OF
OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OR PERFORMANCE

NUMBER OF CLAIMS OR SUITS SHALL NOT ENLARGE OR EXTEND THIS
LIMIT.

These exclusions and limitations of liability shall apply
regardless if NVIDIA or its affiliates have been advised of
the possibility of such damages, and regardless of whether a
remedy fails its essential purpose. These exclusions and
limitations of liability form an essential basis of the
bargain between the parties, and, absent any of these
exclusions or limitations of liability, the provisions of this
Agreement, including, without limitation, the economic terms,
would be substantially different.

        immediately if you violate NVIDIA’s intellectual
        property rights);

      b. (ii) you commence or participate in any legal
        proceeding against NVIDIA with respect to the SDK; or

      c. (iii) NVIDIA decides to no longer provide the SDK in
        a country or, in NVIDIA’s sole discretion, the
        continued use of it is no longer commercially viable.

  4. Upon any termination of this Agreement, you agree to
    promptly discontinue use of the SDK and destroy all copies
    in your possession or control. Your prior distributions in
    accordance with this Agreement are not affected by the
    termination of this Agreement. Upon written request, you
    will certify in writing that you have complied with your
    commitments under this section. Upon any termination of
    this Agreement all provisions survive except for the
    license grant provisions.

 The libffi source distribution contains certain code that is not part
 of libffi, and is only used as tooling to assist with the building and
 testing of libffi.  This includes the msvcc.sh script used to wrap the
 Microsoft compiler with GNU compatible command-line options,
 make_sunver.pl, and the libffi test code distributed in the
 testsuite/libffi.bhaible directory.  This code is distributed with
 libffi for the purpose of convenience only, and libffi is in no way
 derived from this code.

libgcc-13-dev:
This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the GNU compiler
collection, containing Ada, C, C++, D, Fortran 95, Go, Objective-C,
Objective-C++, and Modula-2 compilers, documentation, and support
libraries.  In addition, Debian provides the gm2 compiler, either in
the same source package, or built from a separate same source package.
Packaging is done by the Debian GCC Maintainers
<debian-gcc@lists.debian.org>, with sources obtained from:

  ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/releases/  (for full releases)
  svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/           (for prereleases)
  ftp://sourceware.org/pub/newlib/     (for newlib)
  git://git.savannah.gnu.org/gm2.git   (for Modula-2)

The current gcc-13 source package is taken from the git gcc-13-branch.

Changes: See changelog.Debian.gz

Debian splits the GNU Compiler Collection into packages for each language,
library, and documentation as follows:

Language       Compiler package  Library package    Documentation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ada            gnat-13          libgnat-13          gnat-13-doc
C              gcc-13                              gcc-13-doc
C++            g++-13           libstdc++6         libstdc++6-13-doc
D              gdc-13
Fortran 95     gfortran-13      libgfortran5       gfortran-13-doc
Go             gccgo-13         libgo0
Objective C    gobjc-13         libobjc4
Objective C++  gobjc++-13
Modula-2       gm2-13           libgm2

For some language run-time libraries, Debian provides source files,
development files, debugging symbols and libraries containing position-
independent code in separate packages:

Language  Sources      Development   Debugging            Position-Independent
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C++                                  libstdc++6-13-dbg  libstdc++6-13-pic
D         libphobos-13-dev

Additional packages include:

All languages:
libgcc1, libgcc2, libgcc4       GCC intrinsics (platform-dependent)
gcc-13-base                    Base files common to all compilers
gcc-13-soft-float              Software floating point (ARM only)
gcc-13-source                  The sources with patches

Ada:
libgnat-util13-dev, libgnat-util13   GNAT version library

C:
cpp-13, cpp-13-doc            GNU C Preprocessor
libssp0-dev, libssp0            GCC stack smashing protection library
libquadmath0                    Math routines for the __float128 type
fixincludes                     Fix non-ANSI header files

C, C++ and Fortran 95:
libgomp1-dev, libgomp1		GCC OpenMP (GOMP) support library
libitm1-dev, libitm1		GNU Transactional Memory Library

Biarch support: On some 64-bit platforms which can also run 32-bit code,
Debian provides additional packages containing 32-bit versions of some
libraries.  These packages have names beginning with 'lib32' instead of
'lib', for example lib32stdc++6.  Similarly, on some 32-bit platforms which
can also run 64-bit code, Debian provides additional packages with names
beginning with 'lib64' instead of 'lib'.  These packages contain 64-bit
versions of the libraries.  (At this time, not all platforms and not all
libraries support biarch.)  The license terms for these lib32 or lib64
packages are identical to the ones for the lib packages.

GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION

Version 3.1, 31 March 2009

Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that
bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that
the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.

When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of
certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled
program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of
non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the
header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.

0. Definitions.

A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime
Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an
interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
on the Runtime Library.

"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
subsequent versions published by the FSF.

"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,
modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with
the license of GCC.

"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for
input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
for producing a compiler intermediate representation.

The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in
non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,
use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
understood as starting with the output of the generators or
preprocessors.

A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or
with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
Eligible Compilation Process.

1. Grant of Additional Permission.

You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You
may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.

2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.

The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
requirements of the license of GCC.

specific targets.  Certain clauses only apply if you are building the
code as part of your binary.

Note that this list may omit certain licenses that
only pertain to the copying/modifying of the individual source code.

************************************

libgcc-s1:
This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the GNU compiler
collection, containing Ada, C, C++, D, Fortran 95, Go, Objective-C,
Objective-C++, and Modula-2 compilers, documentation, and support
libraries.  In addition, Debian provides the gm2 compiler, either in
the same source package, or built from a separate same source package.
Packaging is done by the Debian GCC Maintainers
<debian-gcc@lists.debian.org>, with sources obtained from:

  ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/releases/  (for full releases)
  svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/           (for prereleases)
  ftp://sourceware.org/pub/newlib/     (for newlib)
  git://git.savannah.gnu.org/gm2.git   (for Modula-2)

The current gcc-14 source package is taken from the git gcc-14-branch.

Changes: See changelog.Debian.gz

Debian splits the GNU Compiler Collection into packages for each language,
library, and documentation as follows:

Language       Compiler package  Library package    Documentation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ada            gnat-14          libgnat-14          gnat-14-doc
C              gcc-14                              gcc-14-doc
C++            g++-14           libstdc++6         libstdc++6-14-doc
D              gdc-14
Fortran 95     gfortran-14      libgfortran5       gfortran-14-doc
Go             gccgo-14         libgo0
Objective C    gobjc-14         libobjc4
Objective C++  gobjc++-14
Modula-2       gm2-14           libgm2
Rust           gccrs-14

For some language run-time libraries, Debian provides source files,
development files, debugging symbols and libraries containing position-
independent code in separate packages:

Language  Sources      Development   Debugging            Position-Independent
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C++                                  libstdc++6-14-dbg  libstdc++6-14-pic
D         libphobos-14-dev

Additional packages include:

All languages:
libgcc1, libgcc2, libgcc4       GCC intrinsics (platform-dependent)
gcc-14-base                    Base files common to all compilers
gcc-14-soft-float              Software floating point (ARM only)
gcc-14-source                  The sources with patches

Ada:
libgnat-util14-dev, libgnat-util14   GNAT version library

C:
cpp-14, cpp-14-doc            GNU C Preprocessor
libssp0-dev, libssp0            GCC stack smashing protection library
libquadmath0                    Math routines for the __float128 type
fixincludes                     Fix non-ANSI header files

C, C++ and Fortran 95:
libgomp1-dev, libgomp1		GCC OpenMP (GOMP) support library
libitm1-dev, libitm1		GNU Transactional Memory Library

Biarch support: On some 64-bit platforms which can also run 32-bit code,
Debian provides additional packages containing 32-bit versions of some
libraries.  These packages have names beginning with 'lib32' instead of
'lib', for example lib32stdc++6.  Similarly, on some 32-bit platforms which
can also run 64-bit code, Debian provides additional packages with names
beginning with 'lib64' instead of 'lib'.  These packages contain 64-bit
versions of the libraries.  (At this time, not all platforms and not all
libraries support biarch.)  The license terms for these lib32 or lib64
packages are identical to the ones for the lib packages.

GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION

Version 3.1, 31 March 2009

Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that
bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that
the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.

When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of
certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled
program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of
non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the
header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.

0. Definitions.

A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime
Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an
interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
on the Runtime Library.

"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
subsequent versions published by the FSF.

"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,
modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with
the license of GCC.

"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for
input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
for producing a compiler intermediate representation.

The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in
non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,
use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
understood as starting with the output of the generators or
preprocessors.

A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or
with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
Eligible Compilation Process.

1. Grant of Additional Permission.

You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You
may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.

2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.

The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
requirements of the license of GCC.

============

Libgcrypt used to be part of GnuPG but has been taken out into its own
package on 2000-12-21.

Most of the stuff in mpi has been taken from an old GMP library
version by Torbjorn Granlund <tege@noisy.tmg.se>.

The files cipher/rndunix.c and cipher/rndw32.c are based on those
files from Cryptlib.  Copyright Peter Gutmann, Paul Kendall, and Chris
Wedgwood 1996-1999.

The ECC code cipher/ecc.c was based on code by Sergi Blanch i Torne,
sergi at calcurco dot org.

The implementation of the Camellia cipher has been been taken from the
original NTT provided GPL source.

The CAVS testing program tests/cavs_driver.pl is not to be considered
a part of libgcrypt proper.  We distribute it merely for convenience.
It has a permissive license and is copyrighted by atsec information
security corporation.  See the file for details.

The file salsa20.c is based on D.J. Bernstein's public domain code and
taken from Nettle.  Copyright 2012 Simon Josefsson and Niels Möller.

 field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), embedded systems, or IP cores.

 1.5 “Open Source Software” means software whose source code is published
 and made available for inspection and use by anyone because either (a) the
 source code is subject to a license that permits recipients to copy, modify,
 and distribute the source code without payment of fees or royalties, or
 (b) the source code is in the public domain, including code released for
 public use through a CC0 waiver. All licenses certified by the Open Source
 Initiative at opensource.org as of January 9, 2013 and all Creative Commons
 licenses identified on the creativecommons.org website as of January 9,
 2013, including the Public License Fallback of the CC0 waiver, satisfy these
 requirements for the purposes of this license.

 1.6 “Open Source Software Implementation” means a Software
 Implementation in which the software implicating the Licensed Patents is
 Open Source Software. Open Source Software Implementation does not include
 any Software Implementation in which the software implicating the Licensed
 Patents is combined, so as to form a larger program, with software that is
 not Open Source Software.

 2 License Grant

License: The main library is licensed under GNU Lesser
General Public License (LGPL) version 2.1+, Gnutls Extra (which is currently
just the openssl wrapper library), build system, testsuite and commandline
utilities are licenced under the GNU General Public License version 3+.  The
Guile bindings use the same license as the respective underlying library,
i.e. LGPLv2.1+ for the main library and GPLv3+ for Gnutls extra.

However to be able to use and link against libgnutls a program needs to be
available under a license compatible with LGPLv3+ or GPLv2+ since GnuTLS
requires nettle which requires GMP. GMP (>= 6.0.0) is dual licensed
LGPLv3+ or GPLv2+. Starting with 3.5.7 libunistring is needed, too. It also
is dual licensed LGPLv3+ or GPLv2+ (libunistring 0.9.7 and above, earlier
version were LGPLv3+ only.)

Excerpt from upstream's README:

LICENSING
=========

Since GnuTLS version 3.1.10, the core library has been released under
the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 2.1 or later.

Note, however, that version 6.0.0 and later of the gmplib library used
by GnuTLS are distributed under a LGPLv3+ or GPLv2+ dual license, and
as such binaries of this library need to adhere to either LGPLv3+ or
GPLv2+ license.




The GNU LGPL applies to the main GnuTLS library, while the
included applications as well as gnutls-openssl
library are under the GNU GPL version 3.  The gnutls library is
located in the lib/ and libdane/ directories, while the applications
in src/ and, the gnutls-openssl library is at extra/.

For any copyright year range specified as YYYY-ZZZZ in this package
note that the range specifies every single year in that closed interval.

lib/extras/hex.*
Author: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>
Comment: http://ccodearchive.net/info/str/hex.html
License: CC0 license
  Statement of Purpose

  The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

  Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.

  For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

  1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:

      the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;
      moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
      publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;
      rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
      rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;
      database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
      other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.

  2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

  3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

  4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

      No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
      Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
      Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
      Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.

************************************

libgomp1:
This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the GNU compiler
collection, containing Ada, C, C++, D, Fortran 95, Go, Objective-C,
Objective-C++, and Modula-2 compilers, documentation, and support
libraries.  In addition, Debian provides the gm2 compiler, either in
the same source package, or built from a separate same source package.
Packaging is done by the Debian GCC Maintainers
<debian-gcc@lists.debian.org>, with sources obtained from:

  ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/releases/  (for full releases)
  svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/           (for prereleases)
  ftp://sourceware.org/pub/newlib/     (for newlib)
  git://git.savannah.gnu.org/gm2.git   (for Modula-2)

The current gcc-14 source package is taken from the git gcc-14-branch.

Changes: See changelog.Debian.gz

Debian splits the GNU Compiler Collection into packages for each language,
library, and documentation as follows:

Language       Compiler package  Library package    Documentation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ada            gnat-14          libgnat-14          gnat-14-doc
C              gcc-14                              gcc-14-doc
C++            g++-14           libstdc++6         libstdc++6-14-doc
D              gdc-14
Fortran 95     gfortran-14      libgfortran5       gfortran-14-doc
Go             gccgo-14         libgo0
Objective C    gobjc-14         libobjc4
Objective C++  gobjc++-14
Modula-2       gm2-14           libgm2
Rust           gccrs-14

For some language run-time libraries, Debian provides source files,
development files, debugging symbols and libraries containing position-
independent code in separate packages:

Language  Sources      Development   Debugging            Position-Independent
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C++                                  libstdc++6-14-dbg  libstdc++6-14-pic
D         libphobos-14-dev

Additional packages include:

All languages:
libgcc1, libgcc2, libgcc4       GCC intrinsics (platform-dependent)
gcc-14-base                    Base files common to all compilers
gcc-14-soft-float              Software floating point (ARM only)
gcc-14-source                  The sources with patches

Ada:
libgnat-util14-dev, libgnat-util14   GNAT version library

C:
cpp-14, cpp-14-doc            GNU C Preprocessor
libssp0-dev, libssp0            GCC stack smashing protection library
libquadmath0                    Math routines for the __float128 type
fixincludes                     Fix non-ANSI header files

C, C++ and Fortran 95:
libgomp1-dev, libgomp1		GCC OpenMP (GOMP) support library
libitm1-dev, libitm1		GNU Transactional Memory Library

Biarch support: On some 64-bit platforms which can also run 32-bit code,
Debian provides additional packages containing 32-bit versions of some
libraries.  These packages have names beginning with 'lib32' instead of
'lib', for example lib32stdc++6.  Similarly, on some 32-bit platforms which
can also run 64-bit code, Debian provides additional packages with names
beginning with 'lib64' instead of 'lib'.  These packages contain 64-bit
versions of the libraries.  (At this time, not all platforms and not all
libraries support biarch.)  The license terms for these lib32 or lib64
packages are identical to the ones for the lib packages.

GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION

Version 3.1, 31 March 2009

Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that
bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that
the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.

When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of
certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled
program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of
non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the
header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.

0. Definitions.

A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime
Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an
interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
on the Runtime Library.

"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
subsequent versions published by the FSF.

"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,
modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with
the license of GCC.

"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for
input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
for producing a compiler intermediate representation.

The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in
non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,
use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
understood as starting with the output of the generators or
preprocessors.

A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or
with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
Eligible Compilation Process.

1. Grant of Additional Permission.

You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You
may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.

2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.

The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
requirements of the license of GCC.

************************************

libhwasan0:
This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the GNU compiler
collection, containing Ada, C, C++, D, Fortran 95, Go, Objective-C,
Objective-C++, and Modula-2 compilers, documentation, and support
libraries.  In addition, Debian provides the gm2 compiler, either in
the same source package, or built from a separate same source package.
Packaging is done by the Debian GCC Maintainers
<debian-gcc@lists.debian.org>, with sources obtained from:

  ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/releases/  (for full releases)
  svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/           (for prereleases)
  ftp://sourceware.org/pub/newlib/     (for newlib)
  git://git.savannah.gnu.org/gm2.git   (for Modula-2)

The current gcc-14 source package is taken from the git gcc-14-branch.

Changes: See changelog.Debian.gz

Debian splits the GNU Compiler Collection into packages for each language,
library, and documentation as follows:

Language       Compiler package  Library package    Documentation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ada            gnat-14          libgnat-14          gnat-14-doc
C              gcc-14                              gcc-14-doc
C++            g++-14           libstdc++6         libstdc++6-14-doc
D              gdc-14
Fortran 95     gfortran-14      libgfortran5       gfortran-14-doc
Go             gccgo-14         libgo0
Objective C    gobjc-14         libobjc4
Objective C++  gobjc++-14
Modula-2       gm2-14           libgm2
Rust           gccrs-14

For some language run-time libraries, Debian provides source files,
development files, debugging symbols and libraries containing position-
independent code in separate packages:

Language  Sources      Development   Debugging            Position-Independent
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C++                                  libstdc++6-14-dbg  libstdc++6-14-pic
D         libphobos-14-dev

Additional packages include:

All languages:
libgcc1, libgcc2, libgcc4       GCC intrinsics (platform-dependent)
gcc-14-base                    Base files common to all compilers
gcc-14-soft-float              Software floating point (ARM only)
gcc-14-source                  The sources with patches

Ada:
libgnat-util14-dev, libgnat-util14   GNAT version library

C:
cpp-14, cpp-14-doc            GNU C Preprocessor
libssp0-dev, libssp0            GCC stack smashing protection library
libquadmath0                    Math routines for the __float128 type
fixincludes                     Fix non-ANSI header files

C, C++ and Fortran 95:
libgomp1-dev, libgomp1		GCC OpenMP (GOMP) support library
libitm1-dev, libitm1		GNU Transactional Memory Library

Biarch support: On some 64-bit platforms which can also run 32-bit code,
Debian provides additional packages containing 32-bit versions of some
libraries.  These packages have names beginning with 'lib32' instead of
'lib', for example lib32stdc++6.  Similarly, on some 32-bit platforms which
can also run 64-bit code, Debian provides additional packages with names
beginning with 'lib64' instead of 'lib'.  These packages contain 64-bit
versions of the libraries.  (At this time, not all platforms and not all
libraries support biarch.)  The license terms for these lib32 or lib64
packages are identical to the ones for the lib packages.

GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION

Version 3.1, 31 March 2009

Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that
bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that
the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.

When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of
certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled
program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of
non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the
header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.

0. Definitions.

A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime
Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an
interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
on the Runtime Library.

"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
subsequent versions published by the FSF.

"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,
modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with
the license of GCC.

"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for
input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
for producing a compiler intermediate representation.

The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in
non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,
use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
understood as starting with the output of the generators or
preprocessors.

A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or
with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
Eligible Compilation Process.

1. Grant of Additional Permission.

You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You
may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.

2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.

The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
requirements of the license of GCC.

specific targets.  Certain clauses only apply if you are building the
code as part of your binary.

Note that this list may omit certain licenses that
only pertain to the copying/modifying of the individual source code.

************************************

libitm1:
This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the GNU compiler
collection, containing Ada, C, C++, D, Fortran 95, Go, Objective-C,
Objective-C++, and Modula-2 compilers, documentation, and support
libraries.  In addition, Debian provides the gm2 compiler, either in
the same source package, or built from a separate same source package.
Packaging is done by the Debian GCC Maintainers
<debian-gcc@lists.debian.org>, with sources obtained from:

  ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/releases/  (for full releases)
  svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/           (for prereleases)
  ftp://sourceware.org/pub/newlib/     (for newlib)
  git://git.savannah.gnu.org/gm2.git   (for Modula-2)

The current gcc-14 source package is taken from the git gcc-14-branch.

Changes: See changelog.Debian.gz

Debian splits the GNU Compiler Collection into packages for each language,
library, and documentation as follows:

Language       Compiler package  Library package    Documentation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ada            gnat-14          libgnat-14          gnat-14-doc
C              gcc-14                              gcc-14-doc
C++            g++-14           libstdc++6         libstdc++6-14-doc
D              gdc-14
Fortran 95     gfortran-14      libgfortran5       gfortran-14-doc
Go             gccgo-14         libgo0
Objective C    gobjc-14         libobjc4
Objective C++  gobjc++-14
Modula-2       gm2-14           libgm2
Rust           gccrs-14

For some language run-time libraries, Debian provides source files,
development files, debugging symbols and libraries containing position-
independent code in separate packages:

Language  Sources      Development   Debugging            Position-Independent
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C++                                  libstdc++6-14-dbg  libstdc++6-14-pic
D         libphobos-14-dev

Additional packages include:

All languages:
libgcc1, libgcc2, libgcc4       GCC intrinsics (platform-dependent)
gcc-14-base                    Base files common to all compilers
gcc-14-soft-float              Software floating point (ARM only)
gcc-14-source                  The sources with patches

Ada:
libgnat-util14-dev, libgnat-util14   GNAT version library

C:
cpp-14, cpp-14-doc            GNU C Preprocessor
libssp0-dev, libssp0            GCC stack smashing protection library
libquadmath0                    Math routines for the __float128 type
fixincludes                     Fix non-ANSI header files

C, C++ and Fortran 95:
libgomp1-dev, libgomp1		GCC OpenMP (GOMP) support library
libitm1-dev, libitm1		GNU Transactional Memory Library

Biarch support: On some 64-bit platforms which can also run 32-bit code,
Debian provides additional packages containing 32-bit versions of some
libraries.  These packages have names beginning with 'lib32' instead of
'lib', for example lib32stdc++6.  Similarly, on some 32-bit platforms which
can also run 64-bit code, Debian provides additional packages with names
beginning with 'lib64' instead of 'lib'.  These packages contain 64-bit
versions of the libraries.  (At this time, not all platforms and not all
libraries support biarch.)  The license terms for these lib32 or lib64
packages are identical to the ones for the lib packages.

GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION

Version 3.1, 31 March 2009

Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that
bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that
the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.

When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of
certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled
program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of
non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the
header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.

0. Definitions.

A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime
Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an
interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
on the Runtime Library.

"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
subsequent versions published by the FSF.

"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,
modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with
the license of GCC.

"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for
input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
for producing a compiler intermediate representation.

The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in
non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,
use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
understood as starting with the output of the generators or
preprocessors.

A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or
with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
Eligible Compilation Process.

1. Grant of Additional Permission.

You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You
may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.

2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.

The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
requirements of the license of GCC.

The newlib subdirectory is a collection of software from several sources.
Each file may have its own copyright/license that is embedded in the source
file.

This list documents those licenses which are more restrictive than
a BSD-like license or require the copyright notice
to be duplicated in documentation and/or other materials associated with
the distribution.  Certain licenses documented here only apply to
specific targets.  Certain clauses only apply if you are building the
code as part of your binary.

Note that this list may omit certain licenses that
only pertain to the copying/modifying of the individual source code.
If you are distributing the source code, then you do not need to
worry about these omitted licenses, so long as you do not modify the
copyright information already in place.
